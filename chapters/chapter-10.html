            <h2>Hail Holy Queen: The Mother of God in the Word God</h2>
            <p>
                CHAPTER 8.
A CONCLUDING UNAPOLOGETIC POSTSCRIPT.
NOW THAT YOU’VE read most of this book on the Blessed Virgin Mary, perhaps you’re looking forward to speaking with friends, family members, or coworkers who are Christians, but perhaps doubters when it comes to Marian doctrine. If you’re eager to evangelize, then I’m pleased. I wrote this book so that my fellow Catholics would never be ashamed of their supernatural mother as I was once ashamed of my natural mother when she came to take me home from school.
Yet I’d also like to raise a caution, and urge you not to be too eager—or rather, not to be eager for the wrong reasons. I urge you never to forget that, when you defend the Blessed Virgin, you’re defending your mother, not a quarterback, not a goal line. You should defend her only as she would want to be defended. No mother worth the name wants her children to go on the offensive in defending her. No mother worth the name wants her children to be rude in defending her. No mother worth the name wants to be the subject of a schoolyard brawl.
I say this because I sometimes encounter people who practice apologetics as a full-contact sport or as take-no-prisoners warfare. For such apologists, the goal is to win the argument, even if that means utterly humiliating their “enemies.”
That is no way to prove Marian doctrines. Children of Mary have no enemies. We know only our brothers and sisters in Jesus Christ—our adelphoi, from the same womb. We need not so much argue them back home (though arguments are sometimes necessary) as love them home (though love can sometimes be tough).
Moreover, we must never grow overly proud that we have come to recognize ourselves as children of the queen mother. We must never come to believe that we have all the answers. Though the answers are all available to us, no one is ever in full possession of them. God will continue to humble us, to remind us that we’re children, by allowing us to fall and to find ourselves without the right answer at the right moment. He’ll even permit this when we are, ostensibly, working for His good cause.
I can vouch for all of this, because, shortly after my conversion, God brought the message home to me.
I HAD LONG since begun to feel at home in the Catholic Church, and I was elated by how enthusiastically Catholics were receiving my conversion testimony wherever I went. Fundamentalists and evangelicals would sometimes attend my lectures to challenge me, but I was eager to take them on. I knew the arguments before they even opened their mouths—I had once espoused them myself—and I knew exactly the right biblical response. I even began to look forward to these challenges, as a marksman looks forward to the next clay pigeon. I was feeling very much the macho apologist.
Flush with so many successes, I found myself one weekend in the neighborhood of my old Protestant seminary, Gordon-Conwell. I decided to go back and spend some time with the professor I’d served as a teaching assistant. He seemed eager to see me and even invited me to stay at his home while I was in town. He had heard, of course, about my entering the Catholic Church, and he was, to put it mildly, disappointed. He said he was looking forward to discussing the matter at greater length.
I knew that he wanted to challenge me, and I was eager to be challenged.
I arrived, and we greeted each other warmly; but my initial hunch was right. It wasn’t long before my host and his wife began to pepper me with all kinds of questions about the pope, purgatory, the Eucharist, the priesthood, confession…All of which was fine by me, because, through a whole day and into the night, I was like an all-star slugger at batting practice, slamming one slow pitch after another into the bleachers.
Then, around midnight, just as I was beginning to look forward to some well-earned shut-eye, my friend said to me: “What about the assumption?”
I knew what he was implying—that there is no scriptural evidence for the assumption. I was tired, and annoyed that he was bringing up the assumption at that late hour of the night. But I was also unprepared. I replied, “Well, you can look at Revelation 12 and see that there she was, body and soul in heaven.”
“That’s nice, Scott,” he said. “But give me evidence that anyone in the Church believed that before the sixth century.”
I responded that, in all its history, the Church had never honored a tomb as the final resting place of Mary’s bones.
He pointed out, rightly, that the argument from silence was about as weak an argument as one could offer.
I acknowledged that he was right, but countered that times of persecution rarely yield evidence of doctrine or devotion. Survival and perseverance are the Church’s top priorities.
My hosts were not impressed.
And the macho apologist was beginning to feel the effects of a day’s worth of sporting arguments—and a year’s worth of intellectual pride.
I scrambled to point out that, yes, it’s not until the sixth century that the assumption makes its debut in our documentary history—but by then, we encounter it as established and developed, with its own feast days, hymns, and literature. When the emperor declared it a universal feast, there was not even a hint of resistance or controversy.
My hosts smiled. “That’s all well and good, Scott. But the fact is that you don’t have anything to account for five centuries of silence, do you?”
Up to this point, our discussion had been amiable. But now I felt it turn somewhat pointed, almost adversarial.
But I had to respond, “No, I can’t think of anything.”
“Can you recommend a book? Anything at all that I might read?”
I shook my head.
“You don’t have answers from the first five centuries. You don’t have a book I can read—you, who have a book for everything, don’t have a book on the assumption!” He was just savoring the moment, relishing this victory.
I said, “No.”
“Let me remind you, Scott, that this is a dogma, infallibly defined. And you can’t explain to me why there was silence for five centuries?”
“I don’t know,” I said.
It was the closing moment of a dramatic exchange that had gone on for hours, and all my previous triumphs seemed reduced to nothing. I kind of limped up the steps to my guest room bed, feeling like I’d let my mother down.
I sat on the bed, then dropped to my knees and prayed an apology to Jesus. I felt I’d let Him down by letting His mother down. I felt as if I’d run with the ball to the one-yard line, only to fumble short of the goal. I said, “I’m sorry, Lord, for my weakness and failure.” I prayed a Hail Mary. Then I fell, exhausted, to sleep.
They let me sleep in. I woke up at nine, and a plate of scrambled eggs awaited me in the kitchen.
As I sat down and began eating, I noticed that the calendar said Monday, December 8. Something about that date set off an alarm in my memory. Was it a holy day? Then I remembered it was the feast of the Immaculate Conception, my first as a Catholic—and I had almost missed it, staying, as I was, in Protestant territory.
I sheepishly said to my hostess, “Um, today is a holy day of obligation. Is there any way I can get to, uh, Mass somewhere close by?”
She said, “Oh, you’re in luck. Saint Paul’s is in our backyard.” She even called to find out their Mass times—but they had just finished their last Mass for the day. So she proceeded to call around ten nearby churches, without finding a single one that could accommodate me before my flight out of town. Finally she discovered a listing for a Carmelite chapel at Peabody shopping mall, around fifteen miles away.
One more call and she found out that, indeed, the chapel had a noon Mass. There would be just enough time for me to get there, get back to the house, and have my hosts drive me to the airport.
So I got ready for my departure and left for the mall, arriving just a little before noon. I asked directions to the chapel and soon found myself in a crowd of Christmas shoppers making their way down a narrow staircase to the basement. At bottom, I found myself amid a standing-room-only congregation, and I took my place in the back.
A bell rang, and an old priest sauntered out. He must have been in his seventies. And I thought, Oh, no, this is gonna be a long Mass.
Through the first parts of the Mass, I found myself glancing frequently at my watch, thinking anxiously about my flight.
When it came to the homily, though, everything changed. That ancient man stepped up to the pulpit and looked out at us. Surely everyone could see there was a gleam in his eye. He seemed to be speaking directly to me when he said, “We’re celebrating our mother today!”
From there he took off, preaching a firestorm. Billy Graham had nothing on this guy. “If anybody should ask you,” he thundered, “ ‘Why do you believe that Mary was conceived without sin?’ what are you gonna tell him?” He paused.
“What are you gonna tell him?” He paused again.
Then, with a twinkle, he said, “Tell him this: If you could have created your mother and preserved her from original sin, would you? Would you?…Of course you would!
“But could you? No, you couldn’t! But Jesus could and so Jesus did!”
Afterward, I had a hard time concentrating on the Mass, but I surely wasn’t thinking about my flight out of town. I wanted to talk with this priest.
When the Mass had ended, the crowd returned to its shopping, and I made my way back to the chapel’s small sacristy. “Father, do you have a minute?” I asked.
“No,” he replied without looking up.
I said, “Do you have half a minute?”
Finally, he looked up at me. “What do you want?”
I said, “I’m a grad of Gordon-Conwell, top of my class, but I just converted earlier this year.”
He smiled at me as he said, “Gordon-Conwell, up in South Hamilton—I used to teach there. I taught theology.”
I said, “No, I don’t think you understand. It’s an evangelical Protestant seminary.”
He raised an eyebrow. “No, young man, I don’t think you understand. It used to be a Carmelite seminary, and I taught there for decades. …When did you graduate?”
“Eighty-two,” I replied. “Top of my class, a stalwart Calvinist. I converted. Now I’m back to visit, and it’s really humbling.”
“Ha!” he said. “We give them our seminary; they give us their graduates. Seems like a fair exchange.”
Then he remembered how our conversation had started. “So what’s your question?”
I told him the whole story of the previous day, culminating in the humiliation at midnight. “You were so good in your homily, I was wondering whether you might know a book I can recommend.”
“There’s a good reason why you can’t think of any titles,” he said. “There aren’t any titles in print. There was one, and it just went out of print last week.”
I was astonished. “You really know your Marian bibliography, Father.”
He said, “In this case, I should. I wrote the book.”
My jaw dropped. I felt as if I’d entered the Twilight Zone.
“Yes, I wrote it. It’s called The Assumption of Mary, and I was just notified last week that it was going out of print…But I have two copies.” He reached into a cabinet. “What is this professor’s name?”
I told him.
“And you, you’re married, what’s your wife’s name?”
“Kimberly.”
And he inscribed the books with his name—Father Kilian Healy, O. Carm.—for my wife and for my friends.
Then he left abruptly and left me astonished. I drove back to my friends’ house, marveling at God’s mercy.
I pulled up with just enough time to load the car and get to Logan Airport. My former professor couldn’t ride along because he was teaching that afternoon. So we were standing in the driveway saying good-bye.
I said to him, “One last thing. You asked about a book about the assumption of Mary.” I reached into my pocket for Father Healy’s book as, in thirty seconds, I summarized the episode at the chapel. Breathlessly I explained that this was the only book available, and it had just gone out of print, and I had just happened to run into the author at the mall that afternoon.
He was speechless. His wife just laughed as she drove me off to the airport.
As I got on the plane, I felt like a little boy. I pictured Mary patting me on the head and saying, “Don’t worry so much about defending me. Just love me and love my Son, and where you fall short, we’ll make up for what you lack.”
WHEN ALL MY research and rhetoric had failed, when I was thoroughly humiliated according to my own human standards, when I could do no more, then I did what I should have done from the start. I prayed a Hail Mary.
That prayer at the end of the day, in my moment of utter weakness and humiliation, was the turning point in this episode of my life. It set into motion a chain of events that I couldn’t have surpassed with my best-prepared speeches.
When it comes to explaining the Blessed Virgin Mary, having a lot of love is more important than having a lot of answers. When we come up lacking, she’ll make greater goods out of our deficiencies, as only a mother can do. Whenever we’re humiliated and shown our weakness, we should get ready for something better than we could ever plan and prepare to accomplish.
Evangelize with joy, then, and with confidence. Know from the start that you don’t have all the answers—but your Savior does, and He loves His mother. He will give you everything you need, even if sometimes you need to fail.
