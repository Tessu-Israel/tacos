                CHAPTER 4.
POWER BEHIND THE THRONE.
THE QUEEN MOTHER AND THE DAVIDIC KING.
WE’VE SEEN, IN both John’s gospel and the book of Revelation, how the redemptive work of Jesus fulfills many types, or fore-shadowings, in the book of Genesis. The primal creation foreshadowed the renewal and redemption of creation by Jesus Christ (Rev 21:5). The garden of Eden was a type of the garden of Gethsemane. The tree in Eden foreshadowed the wood of the cross. Adam was a type of Jesus Christ; Eve was a type of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
In examining Revelation 12, however, we also glimpsed other patterns of typology. One pattern—considering Mary as the ark of the covenant—inevitably leads us back to Moses, who sojourned with Israel in the desert for forty years. Following Moses, Israel “conquered…by the blood of the Lamb” (Rev 12:11) when they ransomed their firstborn at the first Passover. In the same way, the new Israel “conquered …by the blood of the Lamb,” Jesus Christ, who is the new Moses, the new lawgiver. Following this pattern, we can also see that Moses’ sister, whose name was Miriam (Mary), was, like Eve, a failed matriarch, giving in to idolatry and rebellion against God’s appointed authority. In the new covenant, however, a new Miriam would fulfill the type and model perfect obedience.
Still, perhaps a more striking pattern of typology is to be found in the kingdom of David. It was David’s kingdom that gave ancient Israel its vision of the kingdom of the Messiah. The second Hebrew king, David unified the twelve tribes and established Jerusalem as the nation’s capital and spiritual center. The people revered David for his righteousness, justice, and faithfulness to the Lord. David’s successors, however, never quite lived up to their forefather’s virtue. Whereas David unified the nation, later kings instilled resentment among the tribes. Resentment eventually led to revolt and the dissolution of the unified kingdom of Israel. Weakened Israel was then more vulnerable to its foreign enemies. In time the land was overrun by Babylonian invaders, its people taken into captivity, and David’s line completely wiped out—or almost completely. Zedekiah, the last Davidic king, was made to watch while the Chaldeans, his enemies, executed all his sons; they then gouged out Zedekiah’s eyes so that the last image etched in his memory would be the corpses of his sons—and the apparent end of the Davidic dynasty (see 2 Kgs 25:7).
Yet through exile and all the ups and downs of their subsequent history, the people of Israel would look back to the kingdom of David as an ideal—and look forward to its future completion with the coming of the Messiah, God’s anointed priest-king. Even in Jesus’ day, the Pharisees did not hesitate to identify the Messiah as “the Son of David” (Mt 22:42). For the Lord had promised David that a king in his line would one day rule all the nations, and he would reign forever: “I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth from your body…. And I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be his father, and he shall be My son” (2 Sam 7:12–14). We find the promise cited in the Psalms as well: “The Lord swore to David a sure oath from which He will not turn back: ‘One of the sons of your body I will set on your throne…. Their sons also forever shall sit upon your throne.’ For the Lord has chosen Zion for his habitation: ‘This is My dwelling place forever’” (Ps 132:11–13).
The prophets expressed Israel’s combination of nostalgia and longing, and they foretold the Messiah’s coming with amazing accuracy. Even before the time of Zedekiah, Isaiah foretold that David’s line—the family tree of David’s father, Jesse—would be reduced to a “stump,” but from that stump would come forth “a shoot,” “a branch”: the Messiah (Is 11:1). “Hear then, O house of David!…The Lord Himself will give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel” (Is 7:13–14).

I Dream of Genealogy.
The very first words of the New Testament fulfill the promise of the prophets and the longing of Israel: “The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David” (Mt 1:1). From the beginning Matthew identifies Jesus as the son of David, the long-awaited Messiah. Yet he does this in an odd, almost unprecedented, way. Though a genealogy was traditionally a chronicle of male succession, Matthew anomalously incorporates the names of four women. These women, moreover, all fall far from Israel’s ideal of purity—moral or racial.
The first mentioned is Tamar (Mt 1:3), a Canaanite woman who had sexual relations with her father-in-law (Gen 38:15–18). The second is Rahab, a prostitute and a pagan Canaanite (Mt 1:5; Jos 2:1–24). The third is Ruth, another pagan, a Moabite (Mt 1:5). And the last, significantly, is Bathsheba, “the wife of Uriah” the Hittite (Mt 1:6); it is Bathsheba, of course, who committed adultery with King David.
Matthew seems to flout the rules by listing women in Jesus’ genealogy; but he is actually doing something clever: a preemptive apologetic strike. By placing women—pagan women, and pagan women of shady reputation—among Jesus’ ancestors, Matthew effectively undercuts the arguments of anyone who would question Jesus’ messianic credentials. For surely the evangelist knew that the claim of Jesus’ virginal conception would evoke wry smiles from skeptics. (And it certainly did. Jesus is called a bastard in several places in the Talmud, and the title “Son of Mary” itself was probably a slur. The Jewish custom was to call a man “son of” his father. Only a fatherless man would be called “son of” his mother.) Yet Matthew almost dares his fellow Jewish readers to raise questions about Jesus’ ancestry. Because if Jews derided Jesus as “son of Mary,” then King Solomon, the prototypical son of David, would lose four times over. For Solomon shared those same female ancestors with Jesus—and the last of them, Bathsheba, was Solomon’s own mother.
Matthew is safeguarding Jesus’ messianic credentials at the same time he’s showing the divine handiwork in the virginal conception. Without the Davidic matrix—the kingdom, the promise, and the prophecies—no one can truly understand the coming of Christ. The evangelist continues this oblique line of argument by quoting Isaiah’s prediction about the virginal conception of Immanuel, “God with us” (Mt 1:23). A few lines later, when Matthew recounts Jesus’ birth in Bethlehem, the city of David, he cites Micah 5:2: “And you, O Bethlehem…from you shall come a ruler who will govern my people Israel” (Mt 2:6). Finally, concluding his infancy narrative, Matthew depicts the Holy Family settling “in a city called Nazareth” (2:23). The root of the word “Nazareth” is netser, or “branch”—and “branch” was the name that Isaiah gave to the Messiah, who would spring up one day from the stump of Jesse’s tree (Is 11:1).

Seeing Stars.
Thus, from the beginning of the New Testament, we see that the Davidic kingdom, like the garden of Eden, was a singular anticipation of the coming of Jesus Christ. In this light, the small details of David’s monarchy—again like the small details of the Protoevangelium—take on enormous significance. The structure of David’s monarchy was neither incidental nor accidental; in God’s providential plan, it foreshadowed the kingdom of God.
At the end of the New Testament, in the book of Revelation, the Davidic typology continues as chapters 11 and 12 invoke Psalm 2, the psalm of the Davidic king. The psalm begins, “Why do the nations rage, and the people plot in vain?” Revelation, in turn, shows how “the nations raged,” bringing upon themselves God’s “wrath” (Rev 11:18; see also Ps 2:5). In Psalm 2, God tells the Davidic king: “You are My son, today I have begotten you” (v. 7)—anticipating the words spoken to Jesus at His baptism: “This is My beloved son, with whom I am well pleased” (Mt 3:17). The son of David would rule “the nations” with a “rod of iron,” according to Psalm 2:8–9. In Revelation, this promise is fulfilled as “the woman” brings forth her “male child,” who will “rule all the nations with a rod of iron” (Rev 12:5).
Continuing our study of Revelation, then, in light of Davidic typology, how should we understand the “woman,” this royal figure “clothed with the sun” and crowned with the stars?
First, it is clear that this woman must hold an exalted place in relation to Israel, whose twelve tribes are represented by the twelve stars that crown her head. Indeed, John’s vision evokes the dream of the patriarch Joseph in the book of Genesis, of “the sun, the moon, and eleven stars…bowing down” to him (37:9). In Joseph’s dream, the eleven stars stand for his brothers, his fellow tribal patriarchs.
Yet there’s still more to Revelation’s woman. For in the most glorious days of the old covenant, the twelve tribes would indeed be united, and would pay obeisance to a female royal figure; and this figure surely foreshadows the woman we meet in the Apocalypse.

The Queen Mother.
Israel’s monarchy arose in very specific historic circumstances in a particular geographic region. In the ancient Near East, most nations were monarchies ruled by a king. In addition, most cultures practiced polygamy; so a given king often had several wives. This posed problems. First, whom should the people honor as queen? But more important, whose son should receive the right of succession to the throne?
In most Near Eastern cultures, these twin problems were resolved by a single custom. The woman ordinarily honored as queen was not the wife of the king, but the mother of the king. There was an element of justice to the practice, since it was often the persuasive (or seductive) power of the mother that won the throne for her son. The custom also served as a stabilizing factor in national cultures. As wife of the former king and mother to the present king, the queen mother embodied the continuity of dynastic succession.
The office of the queen mother was well established among the gentiles by the time the people of Israel began to clamor for a monarchy. For Israel had not always been a kingdom. In God’s plan, God was to be their king (1 Sam 8:7). But the people begged the prophet Samuel to give them a king: “We will have a king over us, that we also may be like all the nations” (1 Sam 8:19–20). God, then, allowed the people to have their way. But for His glory: Israel’s monarchy would providentially fore-shadow the kingship of God’s own Son. Israel’s kingdom would be a type of the kingdom of God.
Historically, this played out as the people looked around them for models of governance. Remember, they wanted a king in order to be “like all the nations.” Thus, following the models of the neighboring lands, they established a dynasty, a legal system, a royal court—and a queen mother. We find this in Israel at the beginning of the Davidic dynasty. David’s first successor, Solomon, reigns with his mother, Bathsheba, at his right hand. Israel’s queen mother, or gebirah (“great lady”), appears, then, throughout the history of the monarchy, to the very end. When Jerusalem falls to Babylon, we find the invaders taking away the king, Jehoiachin, and also his mother, Nehushta, who is given precedence, in the account, over the king’s wives (2 Kgs 24:15; see also Jer 13:18).
Between Bathsheba and Nehushta there were many queen mothers. Some worked for good, some didn’t; but none was a mere figurehead. Gebirah was more than a title; it was an office with real authority. Consider the following scene from early in Solomon’s reign: “So Bathsheba went to King Solomon, to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her, and bowed down to her; then he sat on his throne, and had a seat brought for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right” (1 Kgs 2:19).
This short passage packs implicit volumes about Israel’s court protocol and power structure. First, we see that the queen mother was approaching her son in order to speak on behalf of another person. This confirms what we know about queen mothers in other Near Eastern cultures. We see in the epic of Gilgamesh, for example, that the queen mother in Mesopotamia was considered an intercessor, or advocate, for the people.
Next, we notice that Solomon rose from his throne when his mother entered the room. This makes the queen mother unique among the royal subjects. Anyone else would, following protocol, rise in Solomon’s presence; even the king’s wives were required to bow before him (1 Kgs 1:16). Yet Solomon rose to honor Bathsheba. Moreover, he showed further respect by bowing before her and by seating her in the place of greatest honor, at his right hand. Undoubtedly, this describes a court ritual of Solomon’s time; but all ritual expresses real relationships. What do Solomon’s actions tell us about his status in relation to his mother?
First, his power and authority are in no way threatened by her. He bows to her, but he remains the monarch. She sits at his right hand, not vice versa.
Yet clearly he will honor her requests—not out of any legally binding obligation of obedience, but rather out of filial love. By the time of this particular scene, Solomon clearly had a track record of granting his mother’s wishes. When Adonijah first approaches Bathsheba to beg her intercession, he says, “Pray ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you.” Though technically Solomon was Bathsheba’s superior, in the orders of both nature and protocol he remained her son.
He relied on her, too, to be his chief counselor, who could advise and instruct him in a way, perhaps, that few subjects would have the courage to follow. Chapter 31 of the book of Proverbs provides a striking illustration of how seriously a king took the queen mother’s counsel. Introduced as “the words of Lemuel, king of Massa, which his mother taught him,” the chapter goes on to give substantial, practical instruction in governance. We’re not talking about folk wisdom here. As a political adviser and even strategist, as an advocate for the people, and as a subject who could be counted on for frankness, the queen mother was unique in her relationship to the king.

The Key of David.
Without the Davidic matrix we cannot begin to understand the coming of Jesus Christ. For His Davidic ancestry was essential not only to His self-understanding but also to the expectations of His contemporaries, and to the theological reflection of His first followers, such as Saint Paul and Saint John. The Messiah would be David’s son, yet also God’s son (see 2 Sam 7:12–14). The everlasting king would come from David’s house, from David’s “body.” When the “male child” came to rule the nations, He would rule as a Davidic king, with a rod of iron, as David himself had sung.
Yet this typological relationship would not cease with the fact of kingship; it would include many of the small details of the monarchy. As David established a holy city in Jerusalem, so his ultimate successor would create a heavenly Jerusalem. As David’s first successor reigned beside his queen mother, so would David’s final and everlasting successor. The Davidic monarchy finds its perfect fulfillment in the reign of Jesus Christ—and there was never a Davidic king without a Davidic queen: the king’s own mother, the queen mother.
Only with this Davidic key can we unlock the mysteries, for example, of the wedding feast at Cana. Mary approaches her son to intercede for the people—just as Bathsheba spoke to Solomon on behalf of Adonijah. Mary counsels her son about the matter at hand; yet she counsels others to obey Him and not her. Jesus, then, speaks to His mother as her superior; yet He defers to her suggestion—just as one might expect a Davidic king to grant the wish of his queen mother.
This same key of David also unlocks the mysteries of the “woman” of the book of Revelation. She is crowned with twelve stars—representing the twelve tribes of Israel—because she will bear the Davidic king. She is threatened by the dragon because the serpent’s allies, the house of Herod, would set themselves against the reign of David’s house and David’s successor.
Finally, the Davidic monarchy completes the connection between the original Adam and Eve, who failed, and the New Adam and New Eve, who succeeded and won redemption for the human race.
In Genesis we see that Adam was created first and was given dominion, or kingship, over the earth. Yet he was never intended to reign by himself: “The Lord God said, ‘It is not good that the man should be alone’” (Gen 2:18). So God created Eve, Adam’s helpmate and queen. They are to share dominion. When Adam awoke to find her, he said, “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh” (Gen 2:23), a phrase that, significantly, appears elsewhere in the Bible—when the tribes of Israel declare David their king. In acclaiming the youth, they say: “We are your bone and flesh” (2 Sam 5:1). Thus, Adam’s words take on greater significance: they are a royal acclamation.
In Genesis, after Adam exults, the author comments: “Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife” (Gen 2:24). Ancient commentators puzzled over this text, for many reasons. One was that, in the ancient cultures, it was the woman who left her family at marriage; yet here it is “a man.” Most puzzling, however, is Genesis’s reference to father and mother in this context, since Adam had no father or mother. In citing this text from Genesis, Saint Paul acknowledges that this is a profound mystery, but he solves the mystery in the same breath: “I am saying that it refers to Christ and the Church” (Eph 5:32). It is Jesus Who would leave Father and mother to be united to His bride, the Church.
Creation’s initial monarchy would not achieve God’s purpose—nor would the Davidic monarchy—but something later would. A New Adam—Jesus—would reign, as had been foreshadowed in the garden and in the courts of Solomon. The New Adam, the new Davidic monarch, would reign with His bride, the New Eve, and she would be a real historical woman, whom Revelation would identify with the Church. She would be mother of the living. She would be advocate of the people. She would be queen mother. She would be Mary.
