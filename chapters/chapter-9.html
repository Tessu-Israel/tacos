                CHAPTER 7.
THE ULTIMATE CHURCH.
WHO MAKES THE CHURCH A MOTHER?
THROUGH THE CHURCH’S Scripture, Tradition, and dogma, we come to know a mother. We come to know the Blessed Virgin Mary. Yet we must be careful here. For it’s not so much the Church that gives us Mary, as Mary who gives us the Church. More precisely, as Mother of the Church, she gives us her divine Son through the Church, and through the Church she raises new brothers and sisters to Christ.
Biblical typology leads us to see Mary as the New Eve, the mother of all the living, the mother of the covenant Family of God. Typology shows us Mary as the Bride of Christ, too. Yet, at the culmination of the scriptures, in the book of Revelation, that bride and mother is identified with the Church as well.
Revelation shows us the mystical unity between the woman who labors to give birth to Christ (and His siblings) and the bride of the Lamb unveiled at the climax of history. The mother, the bride, the woman is Mary. The mother, the bride, the woman is the metropolis of the New Jerusalem: the Church.

Our Lady of Good Council.
I said that Mary’s identification with the Church is something mystical, but that does not mean it is metaphorical. Biblical typology is more than a mere literary convention, for the Bible is more than literature; the Bible is history. Yet typology is more than historical; it’s prophetic. Still, it’s more than prophecy; it’s reality. And even more than reality, it’s eternity. Thus, when we speak of Mary as Mother of the Church and archetype of the Church, we are speaking of a permanent truth, a person vividly real and a truth that’s essential to God’s plan for the cosmos.
The Church discussed this in a dazzling way in the documents of the Second Vatican Council (1962–65). Though this council produced no single document focused exclusively on Mary, its documents as a whole included more Marian teaching than any other ecumenical council in Church history. In fact, the Marian teaching of Vatican II outweighed that of all the previous councils combined.
Some scholars say that the council’s most important document was Lumen Gentium, the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church. It is at the climatic moment of Lumen Gentium that the council fathers pronounced their most concentrated Marian teaching. The concluding section of that document is titled: “The Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God, in the Mystery of Christ and the Church.”
“This Holy Synod,” it states, “in expounding the doctrine on the Church, in which the divine Redeemer works salvation, intends to describe with diligence both the role of the Blessed Virgin in the mystery of the Incarnate Word and the Mystical Body, and the duties of redeemed mankind toward the Mother of God, who is mother of Christ and mother of men, particularly of the faithful” (Lumen Gentium 54).
The document then pursues a line of argument similar to the one followed in this book, examining Mary in light of theology, typology, dogma, and finally ecclesiology, the theological study of the Church. The council endorses Mary’s typological foreshadowing in the Old Testament as well as her singular and essential role in the New Testament (no. 55). The discussion culminates, however, in an examination of Mary’s ongoing role in the life of the Church.

Membership and Mothership.
How does Mary relate to the Church?
“‘She is the mother of the members of Christ…having cooperated by charity that faithful might be born in the Church, who are members of that Head’” (Lumen Gentium 53, quoting Saint Augustine).
“The Blessed Virgin is…intimately united with the Church” (no. 63).
“She is…a preeminent and singular member of the Church” (no. 53).
She is the Church’s “type and excellent exemplar in faith and charity” (no. 53).
“The Catholic Church, taught by the Holy Spirit, honors her with filial affection and piety as a most beloved mother” (no. 53).
Mary, then, is a mother to the family of God. She is a model for that family, and she actively participates in the children’s “birth and education” (no. 63). As mother, she is a member of the family as, with the Father, she gives the family its particular identity.
The Church, too, is mother—but this is a function of its relation to Christ and Mary. The Church depends upon its intimate union with Mary, and the Church fulfills its own motherhood only insofar as it imitates and honors Mary’s virginal motherhood.
“The Church indeed, contemplating her hidden sanctity, imitating her charity and faithfully fulfilling the Father’s will, by receiving the word of God in faith becomes herself a mother.” The Church, with Mary, is also a Virgin, who preserves and protects the faith that has been given to her by Jesus, her spouse. “Imitating the mother of her Lord, and by the power of the Holy Spirit, [the Church] keeps with virginal purity an entire faith, a firm hope, and a sincere charity” (no. 64).

A Glimmer of Glory.
What do theologians mean, though, when they refer to Mary as an archetype? Put simply, it means that she is a type’s ultimate fulfillment (see Catechism, nos. 967, 972).
As we’ve seen throughout this book, the Old Testament types foreshadowed New Testament realities. But the New Testament realities, in turn, foreshadowed heavenly glories. That’s why the Book of Revelation is such an important book and the capstone of the Bible. It deals with the ultimate fulfillment of all earthly types. It shows the glory toward which God is drawing all history and all creation.
Mary is a central figure in the Apocalypse because—assumed into heaven, where she reigns—Mary is now the fulfillment of the reality of which the Church itself is merely a type. She is the Virgin and Mother, the Bride of Christ, the Heavenly Jerusalem, the metropolis that is the City of God. She is the heavenly archetype. The Church—the rest of us—must struggle toward those mystical realities during all our days on this earth.
Thus says the council:
While in the most holy Virgin the Church has already reached that perfection whereby she is without spot or wrinkle, the followers of Christ still strive to increase in holiness by conquering sin. And so they turn their eyes to Mary who shines forth to the whole community of the elect as the model of virtues…. Seeking after the glory of Christ, the Church becomes more like her exalted Type, and continually progresses in faith, hope, and charity, seeking and doing the will of God in all things. ( Lumen Gentium 65)
Our struggle is individual, but it is communal, too. As members of God’s family, we are concerned for one another and concerned to bring many others into the family. Vatican Council II holds Mary up, again, as a model of the apostolate—the model of our Christian outreach.
Indeed, our efforts at evangelization must have a Marian component. Evangelization should begin with Marian prayer and it should be suffused with Marian doctrine and devotion. For evangelization is all about building up a family, and no one can belong to a family without honoring the family’s mother. Moreover, as the Second Vatican Council pointed out, Mary plays an indispensable role in each of her children’s growth in holiness.
Yet how many people, even among those who are brothers of Christ, do not know they are children of Mary?

Bad for Ecumenism?
All of this brings us to the vexed question of whether Catholic doctrine on Mary is an impediment to Christian unity. Some people—even some Catholic theologians—say that we should downplay our Marian beliefs in the interest of drawing closer to Protestant churches that reject those beliefs.
To do so, however, would be counterproductive. Theology is a true science; its subject matter consists of divinely revealed mysteries. Down through the centuries, many of the doctrinal seeds that were planted by Christ and the apostles have blossomed into dogmas, as defined by the Church’s magisterium. In this manner, theology has developed over time, as other sciences do.
Scientists formulate and test various theories, some of which are proven with enough certitude to be renamed laws, for instance, Newton’s law of gravity; others are discarded as unworkable hypotheses. Thus, laws become the markers of scientific progress. Similarly, the definition of dogma serves as the mark of theological progress.
Dogma is the perfection of doctrine, and doctrine is nothing other than the Church’s teaching and preaching the gospel truth, as Jesus commissioned and empowered her to do. When the pope chooses to define a Marian dogma, he does much more than teach the world a valuable lesson in theology. He uses his God-given charism to fulfill his apostolic mission to preach the gospel to all nations (see Mt 28:18–20).
Throughout the history of the Church, the definition of dogmas has stimulated the apostolic and theological energies of some of her best minds, especially when a definition became the occasion of controversy. In the 1940s, many Protestants, including the late Max Thurian of Taizé, France, objected strenuously after hearing rumors that Pope Pius XII was about to define the dogma of Mary’s assumption. “Where is that in the Bible?” they asked, as they made dire predictions about the death of Catholic ecumenism.
Yet the definition of the assumption coincided with the dawn of a golden age of Catholic ecumenism. Now, almost fifty years later, the Catholic Church can be described as the engine of the ecumenical movement, when many of the institutions of the old guard have lost their steam.
And incidentally, Max Thurian died a Catholic priest on the feast of the Assumption in 1996.
Authentic ecumenical progress is not simply the result of our own human energies. Even more, it is not caused by compromise on either side. “Here it is not a question of altering the deposit of faith,” wrote Pope John Paul II, “changing the meaning of dogmas, eliminating essential words from them, accommodating truth to the preferences of a particular age…. The unity willed by God can be attained only by the adherence of all to the content of revealed faith in its entirety” (Ut Unum Sint 18).
Ecumenical unity thus requires a special grace and the Word of God, who acts for the sake of His family. Accordingly, we should not expect Him to work apart from, but through, the mother He gave us to serve as the symbol and source—the archetype—of family unity.

And in the End.
Whatever our disagreements, these are family matters more than political issues. Indeed, we all should resist the temptation to reduce such matters to ecclesiastical politics or apologetic debates, or to respond to our honest differences by impugning motives. How wrongheaded it is to strive after Mary’s honor in a way that would dishonor her.
While I am not naive in matters ecumenical, I am hopeful, but only because of the Father’s desire to pour out His supernatural power to unite all of His children around His Son and “our common mother” (Redemptoris Mater 25).
This, after all, is what we learn from the typology of the Bible, illuminated by the Church’s dogma. The eternal reality that has been prophesied—the communion toward which human history has been moving as its dramatic conclusion—is the cosmic, corporate, human expression of what God did in Mary, making her bride, making her mother, making her the archetype of a Church that must include us all.
