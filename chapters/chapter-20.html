Presentation

This is a text for the universal Church, yet it can be duly considered in every place in the face of local cultural challenges. The document, in fact, takes seriously the current global context of the development of technological power, in which human beings are tempted to think of themselves as limitless creatures, capable of achieving anything they imagine. In this way, the value of an exclusive love, reserved for a single person, is easily obscured, which in itself implies the free renunciation of many other possibilities.

In truth, the intention of this Note is fundamentally propositional: to extract from the Sacred Scriptures, from the history of Christian thought, from philosophy and even from poetry, reasons and motivations that push us to choose a unique and exclusive union of love, a rich and all-encompassing mutual belonging.

This effort will enrich reflection and teaching on marriage with an aspect that has so far been underdeveloped. At the same time, it could provide varied and useful material for marriage movements and groups for study and dialogue. This explains the length of the Note  and the number of authors and texts cited. Some may find this selection excessive, but we believe that each of the authors and texts cited can provide nuances and nuances that stimulate serene reflection and sustained study.

We will consider the most important works of the Magisterium and a series of authors from ancient to recent times: theologians, philosophers, and poets. We have found a wealth of reflections that emphasize the union of spouses, reciprocity, and the all-encompassing meaning of the marital relationship. Thus, the various texts will compose a beautiful mosaic that will surely enrich our understanding of monogamy.

If, however, one wishes to grasp only a brief reflective summary to justify the choice of an exclusive union between a single woman and a single man, it will be sufficient to read the last chapter and the conclusion of this Note , which focus on the mutual belonging of spouses and on conjugal charity. In any case, we suggest patiently reading the Note in its entirety to fully grasp the breadth of the aspects involved in this rich subject.

I. Introduction

1. [ Una caro ] “One flesh” is the way the Bible expresses marital unity. In everyday language, however, “the two of us” is an expression that appears when there is a strong sense of reciprocity in a marriage, that is, the perception of the beauty of an exclusive love, of an alliance between two people who share life in its entirety, with all its struggles and hopes. “The two of us” is used when referring to shared desires, sufferings, ideas, and dreams: in a word, when referring to stories that only spouses have experienced. This is a verbal manifestation of something deeper: a conviction and a decision to belong to each other, to be “one flesh,” to walk the path of life together. As Pope Francis said : “Spouses too should form a first person plural, an “we.” Standing before each other as an "I" and a "you", and standing before the rest of the world, including the children, as an "us"» [1] . This happens because, although they are two different people, two individualities who each retain their own and non-transferable identity, they have forged with their free consent a union that places them together before the world. It is a union that opens generously to others, but always starting from that unique and exclusive reality of the conjugal "us".

2. Saint John Paul II , speaking of monogamy, maintained that it «deserves to be studied ever more deeply» [2] . His indication of the need for a broader treatment of this theme is one of the motivations that prompted the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith to prepare this Doctrinal Note . Furthermore, at the origin of this text are, on the one hand, the various dialogues with the Bishops of Africa and other continents on the question of polygamy, in the context of their ad limina visits [3] , and, on the other, the observation that various public forms of non-monogamous unions – sometimes called “polyamory” – are growing in the West, in addition to the more private or secret ones that have been common throughout history.

3. But these reasons are subordinate to the first, because, properly understood, monogamy is not simply the opposite of polygamy. It is much more, and a deeper understanding of it allows us to conceive of marriage in all its richness and fruitfulness. The issue is intimately linked to the unitive purpose of sexuality, which is not limited to ensuring procreation, but helps enrich and strengthen the unique and exclusive union and the sense of mutual belonging.

4. As the Code of Canon Law itself states : "the essential properties of marriage are unity and indissolubility" [4] . Elsewhere, the same Code states that marriage is "a bond which by its nature is perpetual and exclusive " [5] . It is worth noting that there is an abundant bibliography on the indissolubility of the conjugal union in Catholic literature: this theme has had much more space in the Magisterium, in particular in the recent teaching of many Bishops in the face of the legalization of divorce in various countries. On the unity of marriage - marriage understood, that is, as a unique and exclusive union between one man and one woman - one finds, on the contrary, a less extensive development of reflection than on the theme of indissolubility both in the Magisterium and in manuals dedicated to the subject.

5. For this reason, in this text we have chosen to focus on the property of unity and its existential reflection: the intimate and all-encompassing communion between spouses . Therefore, in order not to expect from this Note something it does not intend to develop, it is necessary to insist that, in the pages that follow, it will not deal with marital indissolubility—a union that lasts until death separates Christian spouses—nor with the purpose of procreation: both themes are abundantly treated in theology and the Magisterium. The Note will focus only on the first essential property of marriage, unity, which can be defined as the unique and exclusive union between a single woman and a single man, or, in other words, as the mutual belonging of the two, which cannot be shared with others.

6. This property is so essential and primary that marriage is often defined simply as “union”. Thus, the Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas states that «marriage is the marital union ( coniunctio ) of man with woman, contracted by legitimate persons, which implies an inseparable communion of life» [6] , and that «it is evident that in marriage there exists a union by which one is called husband and the other wife; and this union is marriage » [7] . A similar definition was already found in Justinian, who collected pre-existing opinions: «it is the union ( coniunctio ) of man and woman which contains an inseparable communion of life» [8] . Closer to us, Dietrich von Hildebrand maintains that marriage «is the deepest and most intimate union between human persons» [9] .

7. Already in these classical definitions we see that the unity of the two spouses, as an objective foundational fact and essential property of every marriage, is called to constant expression and development as a "communion of life", that is, as conjugal friendship, mutual help, total sharing which, with the help of grace, increasingly represents another union that transcends and encompasses it: the union between Christ and his beloved bride, the Church, the People of God for whom he gave his blood (cf. Eph 5:25-32).

8. Saint John Paul II intimately connects these two aspects. Indeed, if «by virtue of the covenant of conjugal love, man and woman 'are no longer two, but one flesh' ( Mt 19:6; cf. Gen 2:24)», at the same time «they are called to grow continually in their communion […] so that every day they progress towards an ever richer union between them at all levels» [10] .

9. In this Note , therefore, we will examine both unity as an essential property, an objective and constitutive reality of marriage, the first and founding characteristic of all its manifestations, and the different expressions of that same unity which enrich and strengthen the conjugal alliance, thus making it possible at the same time to perceive this unity not as a monolithic reflection of divine unity, but as an expression of the one God who is communion in Trinitarian relations.

10. Finally, it is hoped that this Note on the value of monogamy, intended primarily for Bishops, referring to such an important and at the same time very beautiful theme, may be of help to already married couples, engaged couples and young people thinking of a future union in order to grasp even better the richness of the Christian proposal on marriage. It is true that, for many, such a message may sound strange or against the current, but we can apply to it the following words of Saint Augustine: "Give me a heart that loves, and it will understand what I say" [11] . Moreover, a true passion for the beauty of conjugal love has found expression in the dedication of many believers, men and women, clergy and laity, individually or in ecclesial groups, who have accompanied many couples on their life journey and have also developed a spirituality and a pastoral approach to marriage. For all these shining examples we can only express our dutiful thanks.

 

II. Monogamy in the Bible

11. «They are no longer two, but one flesh» ( Mk 10:8). This declaration of Jesus regarding marriage expresses the beauty of love, a cement which «gives solidity to this community of life, and the impetus which draws it towards an ever more perfect fullness» [12] . Instituted "at the beginning" already at the moment of Creation, marriage appears as a conjugal pact willed by God, as «a sacrament of the Creator of the universe, therefore inscribed in the human being himself, who is oriented towards this path, in which the man abandons his parents and unites himself to his woman to form one flesh, so that the two may become a single existence» [13] . Even if «it is known that the history of the Old Testament is the scene of a systematic defection from monogamy» [14] , given for example the events of the Patriarchs where we read, according to the custom of the time, of characters with more than one wife (cf. 2 Sam 3,2-5; 11,2-27; 15,16; 1 Kings 11,3), at the same time many passages of the Old Testament celebrate monogamous love and exclusive union: «Though the king's wives be sixty, the concubines eighty, the girls innumerable! But my dove is one, my all» ( Song 6,8-9a). This is also attested by the examples of Isaac (cf. Gen 25:19-28), Joseph (cf. Gen 41:50), Ruth (cf. Rut 2-4), Ezekiel (cf. Ez 24:15-18) and Tobias (cf. Tob 8:5-8). On the other hand, if from a factual and normative point of view monogamy does not have solid foundations in the Old Testament, its theological foundations develop in depth, and this is the fruitful path that will be followed in the following reflections [15] .

Monogamy in Genesis chapter 2

12. At the root of the monogamous model, chapter 2 of the book of Genesis presents itself as a true anthropological manifesto placed at the incipit of the Scriptures. It describes the project that the Creator proposes as the ideal for the freedom of the human creature. The divine exclamation: "It is not good that the man should be alone: I will make him a helper ( 'ēzer ) suitable for him" ( Gen 2:18), clearly highlights the need in which man finds himself as soon as he emerges from the hands of God, namely, a state of solitude-isolation. Despite the presence of other living beings, man wants a helper suitable for him (cf. Gen 2:20), a living ally, unique and personal, whom he can look into the eyes, as suggested by the word k e neḡdô , usually translated as "similar" or "corresponding", to highlight the need for a dialogical encounter of glances and faces. In fact, «the original Hebrew expression refers us to a direct, almost “frontal” relationship – eyes to eyes – in a dialogue that is also tacit, because in love silences are often more eloquent than words. It is the encounter with a face, a “you” who reflects divine love and is “the first of all goods, a helper fit for him and a pillar of support” ( Sir  36:26), as a biblical sage says» [16] . Man therefore seeks an irreplaceable face before him, a “you”, with whom he can weave a true relationship of love made of giving and reciprocity.

13. In his commentary on this passage from Genesis, Benedict XVI states: «The first novelty of biblical faith consists […] in the image of God; the second, essentially connected to it, is found in the image of man. The biblical account of Creation speaks of the solitude of the first man, Adam, to whom God wishes to place a helper. Among all creatures, none can be for man the help he needs, although he has given names to all the wild beasts and all the birds, thus integrating them into the context of his life. Then, from one of the man's ribs, God creates the woman. Now Adam finds the help he needs: “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh” ( Gen  2:23). […] The biblical account does not speak of punishment; the idea, however, that man is in some way incomplete, constitutionally on the way to finding in the other the integral part for his entirety, the idea, that is, that he can become "complete" only in communion with the other sex, is certainly present» [17] .

14. The conclusion of the biblical story: "a man will leave his father and mother and be joined ( dāḇaq ) to his wife, and they will become one flesh " ( Gen  2:24), expresses well this need for an intimate union, such a physical and interior attachment that the Psalmist uses it to describe the mystical union with God: " My soul clings to you ( dāḇaq )" ( Ps 63:8; cf. 1 Cor 6 :16-17). As Pope Francis states , "the verb 'to cling' in the original Hebrew indicates a close harmony, a physical and interior adhesion, to the point that it is used to describe union with God: 'My soul clings to you' ( Ps  63:8), sings the person praying. Thus the marital union is evoked not only in its sexual and corporeal dimension, but also in its voluntary gift of love. The fruit of this union is to "become one flesh", both in the physical embrace and in the union of the two hearts and of life and, perhaps, in the child who will be born from the two, who will carry within himself, uniting them both genetically and spiritually, the two "fleshes"» [18] . With the formula " una caro ", the reciprocal and total donation of the couple becomes an exclusive and integral relationship. Therefore, with the suggestive term of 'iššāh applied to the woman (cf. Gen 2:23), the sacred author wanted to remember that these two people constitute a couple, equal in their radical dignity, but different in their individual identity. The fullness of the union between human beings is in this equality made of necessary, dialogical and complementary reciprocity. Ultimately, according to the Creator's original plan, to which Jesus himself refers using the expression "in the beginning" in his commentary on the indissolubility of marriage (cf. Mt 19:4), a man and a woman are called in marriage to a unique, personal, full, and lasting relationship, to an exclusive covenant of life and love, which takes precedence over the social bond of blood (cf. Gen 2:24). From this perspective, the application of the nuptial metaphor to God's relationship with Israel, which emerges with all its force in the prophetic texts, opens an even richer horizon for understanding the life of spouses as a mutually belonging.

Prophetic wedding symbolism

15. In the Prophets, the categories of conjugal love give particular features to the understanding of the alliance between God and his people, no longer modulated according to the canon of pacts between the king and vassal princes.

16. Here, the personal story of the prophet Hosea (8th century BC) emerges in an emblematic way, which is taken as a theological paradigm for rereading the love story between the Lord and Israel (cf. Hos 2:4-25). Despite the betrayal suffered by his wife Gomer, he cannot extinguish his love for her and instead nurtures the hope that she, abandoned and disappointed by her lovers, will "return" on the way home in order to fully restore their love relationship, since that woman is the only one in his life, forgiving her for her betrayals (cf. Hos 2:16-17).

17. This symbolic nuptial transposition of divine fidelity will continue in the prophetic tradition, with different emphases: Ezekiel recounts how God cares for his people, like a man spreading his cloak over a woman (cf. Ezekiel 16:8). On the one hand, this gesture indicates the marital pact in which protection is offered to the wife; on the other, it aims to shield the woman from the gaze of others, thus evoking the exclusivity of the bond.

18. The prophet Malachi condemns the breaking of marital ties among members of Israel and remarriage to pagan women: "For I hate divorce, says the Lord, the God of Israel, and anyone who covers his garment with iniquity, says the Lord of hosts" ( Mal 2:16). This passage has also had another interpretation called "cultic" or "typological," as if it referred to a single perversion (idolatry), placing an implicit parallel between profaning the covenant with God and deceiving one's spouse (adultery).

19. Ultimately, conjugal love truly allows us to describe a dialectic of covenant between Israel and the Lord, between humanity and God. The idea of God as Israel's sole husband is also linked to that of Israel as its sole bride. The uniqueness of the beloved is also evident in the theme of election, which makes Israel the sole chosen people (cf. Amos 3:2). The covenant thus takes on a further dimension in that it designates the bond between God and his people, based on a monogamous bond so real that the worship of another god constitutes adultery.

20. Saint John Paul II offers, in this regard, a beautiful synthesis: «In many texts, monogamy appears to be the only and correct analogy of monotheism understood in the categories of the Covenant, that is, of fidelity and trust in the one and true God-Yahweh: the Husband of Israel. Adultery is the antithesis of that spousal relationship, it is the antinomy of marriage (also as an institution) in that monogamous marriage brings into effect in itself the interpersonal alliance between man and woman, it realizes the alliance born of love and accepted by both respective parties precisely as marriage (and, as such, recognized by society). This type of alliance between two people constitutes the foundation of that union whereby “the man... shall be joined to his wife and the two shall become one flesh” ( Gen  2:24)» [19] .

Wisdom literature

21. All wisdom literature that praises monogamous union as the true expression of love between a man and a woman follows the same line. The passage from the Song of Songs : "My beloved is mine and I am his" ( Song 2:16) represents a true pinnacle here. In this poetic jewel, the woman of the Song expresses her love, using the symbol of the seal that in the ancient Near East designated a person, identified them and was worn either on a bracelet or on a chain around the chest: "Set me as a seal upon your heart and upon your arm. Love is as strong as death" (8:6). The beloved, therefore, declares that she is almost her man's "identity card": one does not exist without the other and vice versa. Intelligence, will, affection, action, and the entire personality of one communicate in the other in a reciprocal and exclusive way, in full symbiosis. Death rises in vain against this vital unity.

22. Furthermore, the affirmation repeated twice in the Song of Songs : "My beloved is mine and I am his [...]. I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine" ( Song 2:16; 6:3), expresses this unity of total giving, of reciprocity and of mutual belonging, as a re-edition of the declaration of love addressed by the man to his woman in Gen 2:23: "bone of my bones, flesh of my flesh".

23. The Jewish and Christian traditions (especially in mysticism) have agreed in interpreting the Song of Songs as an allegory of the covenant between God and Israel, of the relationship between God and the soul. In a symbolic sense, it can be said that the book of the Song of Songs exalts the love of a man and a woman by placing the accent precisely on the uniqueness of an exclusive relationship. In the love story, the two lovers seek and desire each other with a reciprocity in which there is no room for a third party . This fundamental anthropological fact refers back to Israel's profession of faith: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord" ( Deut 6:4). This is one of the most solemn proclamations of God in the Old Testament and it is a proclamation that uses the language of uniqueness when professing the truth of faith. In other words, the Song of Songs affirms that, at the heart of one of the most profound anthropological experiences, such as the loving relationship, there is a uniqueness analogous to that which faith proclaims about God. Therefore, monogamy is profoundly connected to the uniqueness and exclusivity of the God of Israel and goes hand in hand with monotheism.

24. In this regard, Benedict XVI states: «God used the way of love to reveal the intimate mystery of his Trinitarian life. Furthermore, the close relationship that exists between the image of God as Love and human love allows us to understand that “monogamous marriage corresponds to the image of the monotheistic God. Marriage based on an exclusive and definitive love becomes the icon of God's relationship with his people and vice versa: God's way of loving becomes the measure of human love”. This indication still remains largely to be explored» [20] .

25. The double formula: "My beloved is mine and I am his [...] I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine" ( Song of Songs 2:16; 6:3), therefore recalls the theological formula of the covenant between God and biblical Israel: "The Lord is your God and you are his people" (cf. Dt 7:6), and allows access to the theological category of the covenant as a mutual commitment of fidelity. The biblical category of the covenant allows, finally, to outline the sanctity of marriage between husband and wife in its expression of a true community of life and love through a mutual and exclusive gift. All this will become fully evident in the texts of the New Testament [21] .

The wedding symbolism of the New Testament

26. In the Gospel, Jesus explicitly refers "to the beginning", that is, to the origins of the first human couple (cf. Gen 1:27; 2:24), to reiterate that monogamous, faithful and indissoluble love exalts the relationship of the couple, conceived by the Creator in a dimension of totality and exclusivity (cf. Mt 19:3-9).

27. In the Gospel narratives of Mark and Matthew, Jesus expressed himself unequivocally on monogamy, referring to the origins, to the will of the Creator. The debate with the Pharisees on the possibility of divorce offers him the opportunity to make an authoritative pronouncement. He reaffirms the principle of monogamy which is the foundation of God's plan for the family: "From the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.' For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.  So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no man separate" ( Mk 10:6-9; cf. Mt 19:4-6). As the basis of his statement, Jesus combines two weighty exegetical elements: "He made them male and female" ( Gen 1:27) and "for this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and [the two] shall become one flesh" ( Gen 2:24). The first man and the first woman are therefore united by God himself in the one-flesh couple. In other words, Jesus restores validity to God's original plan, going beyond the norm given by Moses and recalling an older one, while at the same time underlining a divine presence at the very root of this relationship: "What God has joined together, let no man separate" ( Mt 19:6).

28. Furthermore, the New Testament, in the wake of prophetic theology, repeatedly introduces nuptial symbolism into Christological and ecclesiological themes (cf. Rev 19:7-9): Christ is called by the Baptist the "bridegroom" par excellence (cf. Jn 3:29), while the bride of the Lamb is the new Jerusalem (cf. Rev 21:1ff.), a fertile mother, saved from the attack of the dragon (cf. Rev 12:3-6).

29. St. Paul systematically develops the theme of full and perfect marital love between Christ and the Church in his Letter to the Ephesians (cf. Eph 5:21-33), taking up, among other things, the passage from Genesis about the couple's being "one flesh" (cf. Gen 2:24). The indissoluble monogamous love between the two spouses—always in line with the theme developed by the prophets to define the covenant between the Lord and Israel—reveals itself as the symbol describing the bond between Christ and the Church. Christian marriage in its authenticity and fullness is, therefore, a sign of the new Christian covenant.

30. The formula of the "great mystery" also deserves attention, as a translation of the original Greek mysterion. This was rendered by St. Jerome, in the Vulgate , with the term sacramentum , which allowed ecclesial tradition to adopt the Pauline formula as an explicit proclamation of the sacramentality of marriage. The passage in its entirety intensely exalts the theological function performed by exclusive nuptial love. The two spouses who unite indissolubly are a sign that refers to the embrace with which Christ draws the Church to himself. Christian spouses, therefore, bear witness in the world not only to a human bond, eros and agape , but are also the living "image" of a sacred and transcendent bond, that is, the one that unites Christ with the community of Christians. Already in Genesis the couple who love and generate were defined as the "image" of the creator God: "God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them" ( Gen 1:27).

31. The Apostle, evoking above all the passage from Genesis in which the two, man and woman, form one flesh (cf. Gen 2:24), defines the intimacy of love between husband and wife as a luminous emblem of the communion of life and charity that exists between Christ and the Church (cf. Eph 5:32). Through this passage from the Letter to the Ephesians, so fragrant in its humanity but also so dense in its theological quality, Paul does not limit himself to proposing a model of Christian marital behavior, but indicates the perfect and unique union between Christ and the Church as the original source of monogamous marriage. It is not only an image of that union, but reproduces and embodies it through the love of the spouses. It is an effective and expressive sign of the grace and love that substantiate the union between Christ and the Church.

32. Finally, we find a beautiful exhortation in the Letter to the Hebrews . After the appeal to charity (cf. Heb 13:1-3), the Author briefly treats marriage, recommending esteem for this bond and respect for conjugal fidelity: "Let marriage be held in high regard by all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled" [22] ( Heb 13:4). The Author exhorts us to hold the institution of marriage in honour, underlining the value of faithful conjugal relations. A solemn warning is added: God will judge fornicators and adulterers, that is, those who do not respect the sanctity and uniqueness of marriage. The exhortation to esteem marriage and the conjugal bed was historically motivated by the fact that various ascetic tendencies denigrated this institution and saw it as a compromise with matter, repeating in their own way what is expressed in Col 2:20-23. The exhortation, however, is not directed against sexual relations, but against those who denied the fidelity of spouses and the uniqueness of marriage.

 

III. Echoes of Scripture in History

33. The revealed Word contained in the Sacred Scriptures has produced, over the long history of the Church, various echoes that we will try to gather at least in part.

Some reflections by Christian theologians

34. It is useful to welcome the richness of Christian thought throughout the centuries, starting from the Fathers of the Church, with their particular importance, up to theologians of different schools and orientations.

Early developments on marital unity and communion in the Church Fathers

35. St. John Chrysostom recognizes a particular value in marital unity. Unlike other Fathers, he maintains that "once marriage had two motives, now it has only one." He explains, in fact, that St. Paul (cf. 1 Cor 7:2, 5, 9) "commands them to unite, not so that they may become fathers of many children," but because this leads spouses to "the abolition of debauchery and unbridled desire" [23] . Ultimately, the holy Doctor considers that the unity of marriage, with the choice of a single person to whom one is united, leads to the liberation of persons from unbridled sexual outbursts, without love or fidelity, and provides adequate guidance for sexuality.

36. St. Augustine, while emphasizing above all the importance of procreation, emphasizes first and foremost the good of unity which is expressed in fidelity: "Fidelity requires not having sexual relations with another man or woman" [24] . Augustine was also able to express the beauty of conjugal unity as a good in itself, described dynamically as walking together, "side by side": "The first natural bond of human society is that between man and woman. And God did not produce each of the two separately, joining them together as strangers, but created one from the other, and the side of the man, from which the woman was taken and formed, indicates the strength of their union. For side by side are joined those who walk together and who together look to the same goal" [25] .

37. Even before Augustine, Tertullian's praise of marriage understood as a unity in the flesh and in the spirit of two who walk "in one hope" was well known: «How shall I be capable of expounding the happiness of that marriage which the Church unites [...]. What a yoke that of two believers united in one hope, in one observance, in one servitude! They are both brothers and both serve together; there is no division as to the spirit and as to the flesh. Indeed they are truly two in one flesh, and where the flesh is one, there is one spirit» [26] .

38. This fact of being "one flesh" is interpreted by the Fathers in an intensely realistic way, to the point that, faced with contradictions in the facts of the reality of conjugal unity, they do not fear to pronounce affirmations such as the following: "he divides his flesh, he divides his body" [27] ; "like the wickedness of cutting his flesh" [28] ; "God did not want the body to be divided and disjoined" [29] .

39. In any case, it must be remembered that the Latin Church particularly emphasizes the juridical aspects of marriage, which have led to the beautiful conviction that the spouses themselves are ministers of the Sacrament [30] . With their consent, they give rise to the unique and exclusive marital union, an objective fact prior to any experience or feeling, even spiritual. The Eastern Fathers, and the Eastern Churches, emphasize more the theological, mystical and ecclesial aspects of a union which, thanks to the blessing of the Church, is enriched over time under the impulse of grace, while the communion between the spouses is ever more integrated into ecclesial communion. This is why in the East the rite of marriage, with all its signs, the prayer and the gestures of the priest, has been given greater value. Already St. John Chrysostom speaks of the coronation of the spouses ( stephánōma ) performed by the priest and explains its mystagogical meaning: «For this reason crowns are placed on their heads, as a symbol of victory, since, having remained undefeated, they reach the marriage bed» [31] .

40. At the same time, a more positive vision of the relational aspect prevails in the East, which is also expressed in sexual union in marriage, without reducing its purpose to procreation alone. This is demonstrated, for example, when Saint Clement of Alexandria takes a strong distance from those who consider marriage a sin, even when they tolerate it in order to ensure the prolongation of the species. Instead, he reiterates: "If marriage according to the Law is a sin, I do not know how anyone can say they know God when they affirm that God's commandment is a sin! No, if 'the Law is holy,' marriage is holy" [32] . Furthermore, for Saint John Chrysostom, marriage "is not to be considered a purchase and sale, but a communion of life " [33] , and he underlines that exaggerated continence in marriage could put marital unity at risk.

41. Conjugal unity and communion as a reflection of the union between Christ and the Church (cf. Eph 5:28-30) is a theme particularly developed by the Eastern Fathers, and St. Gregory of Nazianzus draws concrete spiritual consequences from it: «It is good for the wife to respect Christ through her husband, and it is good for the husband not to despise the Church through his wife […]. But let the husband also take care of his wife: and, in fact, Christ takes care of the Church» [34] .

Some medieval and modern authors

42. In the thought of St. Bonaventure on marriage, substantially homogeneous with that of St. Thomas, which will be discussed later, we can identify a reflection, within the framework of a theological vision, which includes the necessity of consummation so that marriage can fully signify the union between us and Christ: «Since consent, as consent on future action, is not properly consent, but rather a promise of it; and since consent, in truth, before carnal union does not produce a full union, given that they are not yet one flesh, it follows that through the words about the future it is said that marriage has begun, is ratified with words referring to the present, but consummated in carnal union, because then they are one flesh and become one body; and with this the union which is between us and Christ is fully signified. Then, in fact, the body of one is fully given to the body of the other» [35] .

43. It is also useful to recall the theological-pastoral thought of St. Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori, who presents the union and mutual gift of spouses in an integral way (including sexual relations), presenting them as essential intrinsic ends , while considering procreation as an intrinsic but accidental end. Therefore, he maintains that «three ends can be considered in marriage: essential intrinsic ends, accidental intrinsic ends, and extrinsic accidental ends. The essential intrinsic ends are two: the mutual gift with the obligation to satisfy the debt [i.e. sexual relations], and the indissoluble bond. The accidental intrinsic ends are equally two: the generation of offspring, and the remedy of concupiscence» [36] .

44. St. Alphonsus also refers to extrinsic ends, such as pleasure, beauty and many others, which are licit [37] . In this way, the holy Doctor of the Church tries to enrich the vision of marriage in order to develop a pastoral approach that helps spouses to live their union in a richer and more stimulating way. It is permitted to desire marriage also on the basis of a particular attraction to one of these extrinsic ends, because, as long as the principal ends are not excluded, this «is not a disorder» [38] .

45. Closer to our times, the theologian and personalist philosopher Dietrich von Hildebrand takes up the emphasis on the centrality of love in marriage given by the teaching of Pope Pius XI , in order to deepen the understanding of the properties and meanings of marriage itself [39] . With respect to the topic in question, he distinguishes two forms of union which complement each other and enrich the initial approach of this document: the first form of union is expressed with the pronoun “we”, the second with the pair “I-you”. In the “I-you” the two find themselves face to face, they give themselves to each other, in such a way that «the other person acts entirely as a subject, never as a mere object» [40] . This also involves the passage from considering the other as a “he” to one which comes to recognize him as a “you”. Instead, when the union is considered as an “us”, the other is with me, is at my side, walking together motivated by the common things that unite us [41] . The marital union lives on both experiences.

46. In the marital union, von Hildebrand highlights two essential attitudes. The first is " discretio ," that is, a space of personal intimacy that preserves the identity and freedom of each, but which can be shared by a completely free decision, and in this case leads to a deepening of the bond. The second attitude is "reverence" for the other, which manifests, particularly in sexual union, the fact that one loves a sacred and inviolable person, not just any object. The internal dynamism of the marital bond—the "we," according to von Hildebrand's categories—impels spouses to increasingly manifest their intimate personal communion.

47. This vision is also shared by Alice von Hildebrand, née Jourdain, Dietrich's wife. In particular, she maintains that the full realization of humanity can only be achieved in the union between man and woman, the “divine invention”: «not only did He [God] make man composed of soul and body – a spiritual and a material reality – but, in addition to this, to crown this complexity, “male and female He created them”. Clearly, the fullness of human nature is found in the perfect union between man and woman» [42] . Therefore, spousal love between man and woman is considered by the Belgian philosopher and theologian as the pinnacle of human vocation, the supreme expression of the divine image as a call to the gift of self in love, where the tenderness of affection between the two plays a fundamental role, desired by the Creator himself: «The heart is the centre of the person» [43] , warns von Hildebrand, faced with certain temptations to put activism before the receptivity of love, understood precisely in an affective sense. She then adds that «where tenderness reigns, concupiscence moves away» [44] .

48. The character of total self-giving of spousal love can also be seen in what she characterizes as a true "sacrificial" dimension of love – with an evident reference to Christ's love "to the end" – which consists in putting the good of the other before one's own, in what can be called a "death" to oneself, which on some occasions can even lead to renouncing the joys of family life for the sake of a greater good: «What many "lovers" forget, whether we are speaking of friends or of husband and wife, is that sacrifice is the lifeblood of great loves. That sacrifice is the holy vitamin of love also applies to marriage, which offers spouses innumerable occasions to die to themselves» [45] . In other words, this means that spousal love shows its fruitfulness, both human and spiritual, when it remains open to the highest demands of charity [46] .

The development of theological vision in recent times

49. Hans Urs von Balthasar assigns particular importance to the marital consent that creates that new unity that transcends the two individuals: «The coming together of the two people thus dispossessed of themselves is possible only in a third element, which […] is that objective factor that is composed of their two freedoms: their vow, their solemn promise, in which each gives definitive assent to the freedom of the other and to his mystery and delivers himself to this mystery. It is a reality that must be called objective only because it is more than the juxtaposition of their two subjectivities […] their will made one (to belong to each other), which places itself above them and between them, because neither of the two can claim for himself the unity that has arisen» [47] .

50. This pact, where each of the two transcends himself and surrenders to the new reality that is created, is in no way a denial of themselves as free individuals: it is, instead, a fullness of freedom that is achieved in giving oneself totally to another person: «the event of giving oneself in mutual possession, which is accomplished only under the vault spread over them by the Spirit of love that guides and inspires them, is anything but an alienation of self on the part of the individual. The latter does not draw himself except by virtue of the call of the other freedom, which gives him the capacity to resolve, to decide his own, and this resolution becomes mature, 'of age', precisely when he does not continue to recover with hesitation, but concentrates himself, collects himself, to give himself once and for all» [48] .

51. This Author contemplates in a particular and theologically profound way how this marital unity reflects the union between Christ and his Church: "The measure of marital love becomes the love between Christ and his Church [...]. The original unity consists in this, that the Church is born from Christ as Eve was from Adam: she sprang from the pierced side of the Lord sleeping on the cross in the shadow of death and hell. For this reason she is his body, as Eve was flesh from Adam's flesh. In this mortal sleep of the Passion he "formed for himself the Church, a marvelous bride without wrinkle or blemish" ( Eph 5:24-27). He himself, as a man, allows himself to fall into the sleep of death, so that, like God, he can mysteriously draw from the dead that fruitfulness from which he will create his bride, the Church. Thus she is he himself, and yet she is not he himself: she is his body and his bride. "He who loves his wife loves himself. No one ever hates his own flesh; he protects and cherishes it. So also Christ does with his Church, because we are members of his body" ( Eph 5:28-30)» [49] .

52. Such a Christological and pneumatological vision has concrete consequences on the marital experience: «If we return to cast a glance at the mutual dedication of the spouses, it shows clearly once again that the common law of their love (in the Christological sense) flows both from their own attitude of voluntary self-possession, and therefore is not a law imposed from the outside, as it really rises, surpassing both, as a third, fruitful, creative entity (in the pneumatological sense) and inspires them to the acts of their dedication» [50] .

53. Karl Rahner also thinks of marital unity as an expression of the love between Christ and the Church, but not as if Christ and the Church were equal before each other, since the love with which Christ loves the Church has its origin in the "merciful will of God to communicate himself" [51] . From this will, as cause, springs the first effect, which is the unity of Christ and the Church. Ultimately, love, as it is expressed in the life of spouses, reaches its origin in God himself [52] . It is useful to reflect on two texts of Rahner's that are sufficiently eloquent. The first: "In truly personal love, there is implicit something unconditional that goes beyond and above the causality of the meeting of lovers: when they truly love, they continually grow above themselves, they reach a flow that no longer has its point of arrival in the finite and the determinable. What lies in an infinite distance, which is silently evoked in such love, can ultimately be called by only one name: God» [53] . And the second text: «Marriage and the bond between God and humanity in Christ can not only be compared with each other by us , but rather they are objectively in a reciprocal relationship such that marriage objectively represents this love that God has in Christ for the Church, the relationship and behavior of Christ with the Church prefigures the relationship and behavior that exists in marriage, and finds its completion in it, so that it includes marriage in itself as a moment of itself» [54] .

54. The Christological-Trinitarian perspective on marital unity has been strongly and poetically emphasized by several contemporary Orthodox authors. We give three examples:

55. Starting from his own mystical vision, the Orthodox theologian Alexander Schmemann states: «In a Christian marriage, in fact, there are three married people; and the united loyalty of the two to the third, who is God, keeps the two in an active unity with each other and with God. However, it is precisely the presence of God that marks the end of marriage as something purely “natural”. It is the cross of Christ that puts an end to the self-sufficiency of nature. But “with the cross, joy has entered the whole world”. His presence is therefore the true joy of marriage» [55] .

56. Another beautiful testimony is found in the following words of the Russian philosopher and theologian Pavel Evdokimov: «The consubstantial unity of marriage constitutes the unity of two persons who are placed in God […]. Therefore the initial Trinitarian structure is: man-woman in the Holy Spirit. The effective realization of their unity in marriage (where the husband, according to Paul, is the image of Christ and the wife is the image of the Church) becomes the conjugal equivalent of the Christ-Spirit unity» [56] .

57. Finally, it is worth quoting an enlightened passage from the theologian John Meyendorff: «A Christian is called – already in this world – to experience a new life, to become a citizen of the Kingdom, and he can do so in marriage […]. It is a singular union of two beings in love, two beings who can transcend their own humanity and thus be united not only “with each other”, but also “in Christ”» [57] .

58. The Eastern authors of our time also insist on the relational aspect in the light of the Trinity. The Greek theologian, Ioannis Zizioulas, states that «the person is otherness in communion and communion in otherness. The Person is an identity that emerges through the relationship ( schesis , in the terminology of the Greek Fathers); it is an “I” that can exist only as long as it relates to a “you” who affirms its existence and its otherness. […] [The “I”] cannot simply be without the other. This is what distinguishes the person from the individual» [58] . In the context of this particular Eastern evaluation of the relationship, which is ultimately a reflection of Trinitarian communion, another Greek theologian and philosopher, Christos Yannaras, shows how married life must be understood in the broader framework of relationships in the ecclesial community, which allows us to understand sexuality as a personal relationship transfigured by Trinitarian grace: «The relationship and knowledge between spouses become ecclesial events, they are brought about not only through nature but also through the Church […] within the context of the relationships that hold the Church together as an image of the Trinitarian model» [59] . And he immediately explains that «this does not mean 'spiritualization' of marriage and devaluation of the natural relationship, but dynamic transformation of the natural impulse into an event of personal communion, according to the way in which the Church brings about communion, that is, as a grace-free gift of otherness and personal freedom» [60] .

Magisterial interventions

First interventions

59. Until Leo XIII , the interventions referring to monogamy were few and essential. Worth mentioning is a brief but important intervention by Innocent III in the year 1201, in which he refers to pagans who «share conjugal affection with several women at the same time», and with reference to Genesis he states that it is contrary to the Christian faith, «since from the beginning one rib was changed into one woman» [61] . He then refers to Scripture (cf. Eph 5:31; Gen 2:24; Mt 19:5) to underline that it says that «they will be two in one flesh» ( duo in carne una ) and that the man will unite himself “to his wife”, not “to his wives”. Finally, he interprets the prohibition of adultery (cf. Mt 19:9; Mk 10:11) as referring to monogamous marriage [62] .

60. The Second Council of Lyons again maintains that it is "held as firm that it is not permitted for a man to have more than one wife at the same time, nor for a woman to have more than one son" [63] . The Council of Trent derives the meaning of monogamy from the fact that Christ the Lord taught more openly that with this bond only two people are closely united, when he said: "Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh" [64] . In the 18th century, Benedict XIV , taking into consideration the situation of clandestine marriages, reiterates that "neither of the two can, as long as the other is alive, move on to another marriage" [65] .

Leo XIII

61. On the subject of monogamy, the central argument that spouses constitute "one flesh" returns in the teaching of Leo XIII : «We see this declared and solemnly ratified by the Gospel with the divine authority of Jesus Christ, who proclaimed to the Jews and the Apostles that marriage, by its very institution, must be only between two, that is, between a man and a woman ; that the two are formed as one flesh» [66] .

62. In his reflection, the defense of monogamy is equally a defense of the dignity of women, which cannot be denied or dishonoured even by the desire for procreation. The unity of marriage therefore implies a free choice by the woman, who has the right to demand exclusive reciprocity: «Nothing was more miserable than the wife, lowered to such vileness that she was almost considered only as an instrument destined to satisfy lust or to procreate children. Nor did he blush at the fact that those who were to be placed as wives were bought and sold like corporeal things, the power having sometimes been given to the father or the husband to condemn the wife to the extreme torture» [67] .

63. Monogamous marriage is the expression of a mutual and exclusive search for the good of the other: «It is necessary that they always have their minds so disposed as to understand that one owes the other a very great love, a constant faith, a solicitous and continuous help» [68] . This reality of being “one flesh” acquires with Christ a new and precious motivation and reaches its fullness in the Sacrament of Matrimony: «It should be added that marriage is a Sacrament precisely for this: that it is a sacred sign, which produces grace and renders an image of the mystical wedding of Christ with the Church. The form and shape of these are then expressed by that same bond of perfect union by which man and woman are joined together, and which is nothing other than marriage itself» [69] . 

Pius XI

64. Pope Pius XI offers a further development of the doctrine on marital unity in the Encyclical Casti connubii . He emphasizes the value of the "mutual fidelity of the spouses in the fulfillment of the marriage contract; so that what pertains by this contract sanctioned by divine law to the spouse alone, is neither denied to him nor permitted to a third person." And he concludes: "This faith therefore demands in the first place the absolute unity of marriage , which the Creator himself foreshadowed in the marriage of the first parents, wanting it to be only between one man and one woman" [70] . 

65. The Pontiff then enriches the teaching on the unity of marriage by proposing a new reflection on conjugal love, "which pervades all the duties of conjugal life and in Christian marriage holds the primacy of nobility " [71] . And the noblest thing that can be found in a marriage is conjugal love, especially when it reaches the supernatural level of charity through grace. As a consequence, the marital union becomes a path of spiritual growth: "It does not only include mutual help, but must also extend to, and indeed aim above all at, this: that the spouses help each other for an ever better interior formation and perfection, so that in their mutual union of life they grow ever more in the virtues, especially in sincere charity towards God and towards their neighbour [...]. This mutual interior formation of the spouses, with the assiduous effort to perfect each other, in a certain very true sense [...] can also be said to be the primary cause and motive of marriage " [72] . This “broadening” of the meaning of marriage, which goes beyond the narrow sense, predominant until then, of an institution ordered to the procreation and proper education of offspring, has opened the way for a deeper understanding of the unitive meaning of marriage and sexuality.

66. One can also recall how in his time Pope Pius XI felt compelled to highlight those tendencies contrary to monogamy which have become much more common today: «Those who think that we should be indulgent towards the ideas and customs of our time regarding false and harmful friendships with third parties, and who maintain that in these external relationships spouses should be allowed a certain greater license to think and act, are corrupting fidelity first of all, and this is all the more true since (as they say) not a few have an innate sexual constitution which they cannot satisfy within the narrow confines of monogamous marriage. Therefore that disposition of mind by which honest spouses condemn and refuse every affection and libidinous act with a third person, they consider an antiquated weakness of mind and heart or an abject and vile jealousy; therefore they declare the penal laws of the State regarding the obligation of conjugal faith to be null and void» [73] .

The times of the  Second Vatican Council

67. Following the path opened by Casti connubi , the Second Vatican Council presents marriage first of all as a work of God which consists in a communion of love and life which the two spouses share, a communion which is not only oriented towards procreation, but also towards the integral good of both. Marriage is defined as an "intimate communion of life and conjugal love" [74] . In marriage, the man and the woman, who through the conjugal covenant "'are no longer two, but one flesh' ( Mt 19:6), offering each other mutual help and service through the intimate union of their persons and activities, experience the sense of their own unity and achieve it ever more fully . This intimate union, as a mutual gift of two persons, as well as the good of the children, demand the full fidelity of the spouses and demand their indissoluble unity" [75] .

68. Christ himself "comes to meet Christian spouses through the sacrament of marriage. He also remains with them so that, just as he loved the Church and gave himself up for her, so too spouses may love one another faithfully, forever, with mutual dedication. Authentic conjugal love is taken up into divine love and is sustained and enriched by the redemptive power of Christ and the saving action of the Church" [76] . In this way, it is possible to live conjugal love: "being directed from person to person with a feeling that arises from the will, that love embraces the good of the whole person; therefore it has the possibility of enriching with a particular dignity the expressions of the body and of the psychic life and of ennobling them as special elements and signs of conjugal friendship. The Lord has deigned to heal, perfect and elevate this love with a special gift of grace and charity. Such love, uniting human and divine values, leads spouses to a free and mutual gift of themselves, which is expressed through tender feelings and gestures and pervades the entire life of the spouses» [77] . Sexual acts in marriage, «carried out in a truly human way, foster the mutual giving which they signify and enrich the spouses themselves mutually with joy and gratitude» [78] . 

69. The Council refers explicitly to marital unity to express that it, «confirmed by the Lord, is also clearly evident from the equal personal dignity which must be recognized in both man and woman in their mutual and complete love» [79] . The defense of marital unity in the Council is thus based on two firm points: on the one hand, the Council reiterates that marital union is all-encompassing, «it pervades the entire life of the spouses» [80] , and consequently is only possible between two people; on the other, it underlines that such love corresponds to the equal dignity of each of the two spouses, who, in the case of a “plural” union, would find themselves in the situation of having to share with others what should be intimate and exclusive, thus becoming like objects, in a relationship which debases their own personal dignity [81] .

70. Saint Paul VI , having concluded the Council and resuming his reflections on marriage, expresses a profound concern regarding the themes of marriage and the family. Even if in Humanae Vitae he wishes to underline the procreative meaning of marriage and sexual acts, at the same time he wishes to show that this meaning is inseparable from the other: the unitive one. In fact, he affirms that «because of its intimate structure, the conjugal act, while profoundly uniting the spouses , makes them capable of generating new lives» [82] . In this context, he reaffirms the value of reciprocity and exclusivity which recalls the communion of love and mutual perfection [83] . There is an «inseparable connection» between the two meanings of sexual acts: «By safeguarding both these essential aspects, the unitive and the procreative, the conjugal act fully preserves the sense of mutual and true love and the ordination to man's highest vocation in fatherhood» [84] . Therefore, if we say that the unitive meaning is inseparable from procreation, we must say at the same time that the pursuit of procreation is inseparable from the unitive meaning, as Saint John Paul II later clarified : «total physical donation would be a lie, if it were not the sign and fruit of total personal donation» [85] .

Saint John Paul II

71. Saint John Paul II uses Christ's reference "in the beginning" to introduce, in the reflection on the spousal relationship, the hermeneutic of the gift [86] . In Creation, God's self-giving is revealed and Creation itself constitutes the fundamental and original gift. The human being is the only creature who can receive the created world as a gift and who can, at the same time, as the image of God, make his own life a gift. It is in this logic that the spousal meaning of the human body, in its masculinity and femininity, reveals that the human being was created to give himself to the other and that only in this gift of himself does he bring to completion the true meaning of his being and his existence [87] .

72. In this context, in his exposition of the Christian concept of monogamy, Saint John Paul II supports the Semitic and non-Western origin of its deepest foundations, affirming that "it appears as the expression of the interpersonal relationship, one in which each of the two partners is recognized by the other as having equal value and in the totality of his person. This monogamous and personalist concept of the human couple is an absolutely original revelation, which bears the mark of God, and which deserves to be ever more deeply explored" [88] .

73. The Holy Pontiff must however recognize that «the whole tradition of the Old Covenant indicates that   the effective need for monogamy never reached the conscience of successive generations of the chosen people, their ethos […] adultery is not understood as it appears from the point of view of monogamy established by the Creator» [89] . For this reason, he strives to read the Old Testament not from the normative point of view, but from the theological point of view, and he does so starting from two cornerstones. The first is Christ's will to return to the beginning [90] , to the origin of Creation, when the original couple was monogamous, in the sense of "two in one flesh": «God made man in his own likeness, creating him male and female. This is what is surprising right from the start. Humanity, to resemble God, must be a couple of two people who move towards each other» [91] . The other point of reference is the reflection of the prophets on the exclusive love between God and his people, for which «they often denounce the abandonment of the true God Yahweh by the people, comparing it to adultery […]. Adultery is a sin because it constitutes  the breaking of the personal alliance between man and woman […]. In many texts monogamy appears to be the only and correct analogy of monotheism understood in the categories of the Alliance, that is, of fidelity and trust in the one and true God-Yahweh: Husband of Israel. Adultery is the antithesis of that spousal relationship, it is the antinomy of marriage» [92] .

74. Following this line of thought, Saint John Paul II maintains that this union does not express God's original will for monogamy if the other person, even if the union is exclusive , becomes merely an object used to satisfy one's own desires: «The personal union or 'communion' to which man and woman are mutually called 'from the beginning' does not correspond, but rather conflicts with it, if one of the two persons exists only as a subject for the satisfaction of sexual need, and the other becomes exclusively the object of such satisfaction. Furthermore, the case where both, man and woman, exist reciprocally as an object for the satisfaction of sexual need, and each for her part is merely the subject of that satisfaction, does not correspond to this unity of 'communion' – indeed it conflicts with it. Such a 'reduction' of such a rich content of the mutual and perennial attraction of human persons […] extinguishes the personal meaning and the 'communion' meaning proper to man and woman» [93] .

75. The gift of the "Holy Spirit poured out in the sacramental celebration offers Christian spouses the gift of a new communion of love which is a living and real image of that most singular unity which makes the Church the indivisible Mystical Body of the Lord Jesus […] a stimulating impulse so that they may progress every day towards an ever richer union between them at all levels - of bodies, characters, hearts, minds, wills, souls" [94] .

Benedict XVI

76. Benedict XVI takes up this teaching again when he recalls, also recalling the story of Creation, that «eros is rooted in the very nature of man; Adam is searching and 'abandons his father and mother' to find the woman; only together do they represent the entirety of humanity, they become 'one flesh'. The second aspect is no less important: in an orientation founded in creation, eros refers man to marriage, to a bond characterized by uniqueness and definitiveness; thus, and only thus, is its intimate destination realized» [95] .

77. Benedict XVI also taught that marriage does nothing other than gather and bring to completion that disruptive force which is love, which, in its dynamic of exclusivity and definitiveness, does not want to mortify human freedom, but, on the contrary, opens life to nothing less than a horizon of eternity: «It is part of the development of love towards higher levels, towards its intimate purifications, that it now seeks definitiveness, and this in a double sense: in the sense of exclusivity – “only this one person” – and in the sense of “forever”» [96] .

Francis

78. Pope Francis has given us an original reflection rooted in concrete experience on various aspects of the exclusive union of spouses in the fourth chapter of the Apostolic Exhortation Amoris laetitia , where one can find a detailed description of conjugal love in its various manifestations, taking as its starting point 1 Cor 13:4-7. First of all, patience, without which "we will always have excuses for responding with anger, and in the end we will become people who do not know how to live together, antisocial, incapable of controlling our impulses" [97] ; then benevolence, "doing good" as a "dynamic and creative reaction towards others" [98] ; then kindness, because those who have learned to love "hate making others suffer" [99] and "are capable of speaking words of encouragement, which comfort, which give strength, which console, which stimulate" [100] . Love also implies a certain “self-detachment”, to give oneself freely to the point of giving one's life [101] . Consequently, love is capable of overcoming interior violence towards the defects of others, which «puts us on the defensive before others» and «ends up isolating us» [102] . To all this is added forgiveness, which «presupposes the experience of being forgiven by God» [103] , the capacity to rejoice with others, so that «whoever does something good in life knows that they will celebrate it with him» [104] ; and trust, because love «leaves freedom, it renounces the attempt to control everything, to possess, to dominate» [105] . Finally, love hopes for the other, «it always hopes that a maturation is possible, a surprising blossoming of beauty, that the potentialities of his being will one day sprout» [106] .

79. Pope Francis thus helps us to "embody" what "conjugal charity" is. At the same time, with healthy realism, he warns of the danger of idealizing the marital union with inadequate deductions, as if the theological mysteries had to find a perfect correspondence in the life of the couple, and the latter had to be perfect in every circumstance. In reality, this would create a constant sense of guilt in the more fragile spouses, who struggle and do their best to maintain their union: "It is not good to confuse different levels: one must not place upon two limited persons the tremendous burden of having to reproduce in a perfect manner the union that exists between Christ and his Church, because marriage as a sign implies 'a dynamic process, which advances gradually with the progressive integration of the gifts of God'" [107] . Instead, we must positively evaluate all the efforts, the painful moments, the challenges that have surprised and destabilized the spouses, the changes in the loved one, and even the defeats that have subsequently been overcome, as part of a journey where the Holy Spirit works as he wishes, because in this way, «after having suffered and fought together, the spouses can experience that it was worth it, because they have achieved something good, they have learned something together, or because they can appreciate more what they have. Few human joys are as profound and joyful as when two people who love each other have achieved something together that cost them a great shared effort» [108] .

Leo XIV

80. Among the first interventions of Pope Leo XIV , in reference to the theme of this Note , one can take into consideration what he expressed in the message for the commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the canonization of the couple Louis and Zélie Martin, parents of Saint Thérèse of the Child Jesus . On that occasion, the Holy Father refers to the "model of the couple that the Holy Church presents to young people" as "such a beautiful adventure: a model of fidelity and attention to others, a model of fervor and perseverance in the faith, of the Christian education of children, of generosity in the exercise of charity and social justice; a model also of trust in times of trial" [109] .

81. In truth, the motto of Pope Leo XIV , « In illo uno, unum » (« in Him who is One, we are one »), taken from a passage of Saint Augustine [110] , could be applied to the life of a couple, suggesting that « being one » is possible and fully realisable in God. In this sense, marital unity finds its foundation and its completeness in the relationship with God. On the occasion of the Jubilee of families, grandparents and the elderly, Pope Leo XIV , addressing spouses directly, reiterated that « marriage is not an ideal, but the canon of true love between man and woman: a total, faithful, fruitful love […]. While transforming you into one flesh, this same love makes you capable, in the image of God, of giving life » [111] .

82. The Code of Canon Law refers to the "matrimonial covenant by which a man and a woman establish between themselves a partnership of the whole of life , ordered by its nature to the good of the spouses and to the procreation and education of offspring", and recalls that "among the baptized it has been raised by Christ the Lord to the dignity of a sacrament" [112] .

83. Finally, in its synthetic vision, the Catechism of the Catholic Church states that: « Polygamy is contrary to this equal dignity and to conjugal love which is unique and exclusive» [113] . Furthermore, «conjugal love demands from spouses, by its very nature, an inviolable fidelity. This is the consequence of the gift of themselves which spouses make to each other» [114] . For this reason, «adultery is an injustice. Whoever commits it fails to fulfil the commitments undertaken. He wounds that sign of the Covenant which is the marriage bond, injures the rights of the other spouse and attacks the institution of marriage, violating the contract on which it is founded. It compromises the good of human generation and of children, who need the stable union of their parents» [115] . This does not exclude the possibility of understanding "the drama of those who, desiring to convert to the Gospel, find themselves obliged to repudiate one or more women with whom they have shared years of married life. However,  polygamy  is in contrast with the moral law. It radically contradicts conjugal communion" [116] .

 

IV. Some perspectives from philosophy and cultures

In classical Christian thought

84. In St. Thomas Aquinas we can find a Christian philosophical thought, which has become classic, on the foundations of monogamy. In the third book of the Summa contra Gentiles , his conception appears above all under the philosophical profile, with reasoning drawn from natural theology and from his knowledge of the biology of the time. The spousal relationship is thus presented as a bond of the natural order, a "society of man (and) woman" [117] or a form of "social bond ( socialis coniunctio )" [118] , inherent in human nature, which unites man and woman.

85. St. Thomas maintains that monogamy derives essentially from natural instinct, being inscribed in the nature of every human being; this sphere therefore prescinds from the demands of faith . In fact, "man [...] naturally desires to be certain of his offspring, which certainty would be completely eliminated if several men had only one woman. Therefore it follows from natural instinct that there should be only one woman for one man" [119] . This union, which consolidates the mutual balance between man and woman, is governed by "a natural equity". There is therefore no room either for some form of polyandry, nor for polygamy which, among other things, Aquinas defines as a form of slavery: "It is also evident that the dissolution of the aforementioned society is incompatible with equity [...]. If, therefore, a man taking a woman in her youth, when she is beautiful and fertile, could leave her later when she is old, he would be doing the woman an injustice against natural equity […]. On the other hand, if a man could abandon his wife, there would not be a society of equals between man and woman, but slavery on the part of the woman» [120] .

86. Furthermore, equity in love establishes a substantial equality between spouses, that is, a fundamental equality between man and woman: «Friendship consists in a certain equality. Therefore, if a woman were not allowed to have more than one husband, so as not to jeopardize the security of her offspring, while a husband were permitted to have more than one wife, friendship between man and woman would not be liberal but almost servile. And this argument is proven by experience: since among men who have more than one wife, these are held almost as slaves. “An intense friendship is not possible towards many people,” as the Philosopher explains (Ethic. iv). If, therefore, the wife had only one husband, but the husband had more than one wife, friendship would not be equal on both sides» [121] .

87. Marital fidelity, therefore, has as its foundation that highest degree of friendship which is established between man and woman. This friendship at the highest degree ( maxima amicitia ), as a love of benevolence ( amor benevolentiae ), different from the mere love of concupiscence ( amor concupiscentiae ) which is oriented rather towards one's own advantage, leads to an intimate and total exchange between equals, in which each partner gives himself without reserve, seeking the good of the other: «The greater the friendship, the more firm and lasting it is. Now, between husband and wife, there is a very great friendship ( maxima amicitia ): since they are united not only for carnal intercourse, which even among beasts establishes a certain sweet society, but for the community of all domestic life ; so that to express this, the man "leaves even his father and mother for his wife", as it is said in Genesis (2,24)» [122] .

Communion of two people

88. In the twentieth century, some Christian philosophers emphasized a vision of marriage as a union between persons or a communion of life. In the context of classical Thomistic thought, Antonin-Dalmace Sertillanges presents marriage as a union of two persons , which can never be understood as a kind of fusion or destruction of themselves to constitute a superior unity, nor even as a pure means of procreation for the good of the species: «Man, precisely because he is a person, that is, an end in himself , man who is valid in himself independently of the species, will seek in his union, together with the good of the species, also his own good. If, therefore, man and woman found a life cemented by love, this life will develop in two centers like an ellipse in two focuses […] without anyone being sacrificed» [123] .

89. Consistent with this thought, Sertillanges shows that in marriage even the pursuit of a good for oneself constitutes a way of taking the other person seriously, opening up for him the possibility of being fruitful thanks to his spouse: «Certainly it is better to give than to receive, we said; but receiving is also a giving. O my heart, receive, so that your friend may find in you the testimony of what he gives. Be happy, so that your friend may say: I therefore bring happiness!» [124] . In this way, «in the conjugal union the two lives are enriched all the better the closer their association is destined to become and their mutual contributions are destined by nature to complement each other» [125] , because «this love which makes two people united what each of them, alone, could not be, is the most decisive natural enrichment» [126] . In this way, marital communion implies a "double preference which intertwines to form the strongest of knots, and makes each of the two simultaneously the most loving and the most loved, and makes each obtain what is due to him just as he procures it for the other; the happiness of being one in two" [127] .

A person entirely referred to another

90. At this point, it is useful to connect three authors who have increasingly explored a line of thought on marital unity. The first is Søren Kierkegaard. He is convinced that a person fulfils himself when he is capable of going out of himself, thus making love and union possible: «Love is abandonment, but abandonment is only possible thanks to the fact that I go out of myself» [128] , accepting the risk and the unpredictability. Only in this way does the decision to belong fully to a single person become possible, with all the risks that this decision may entail: «a decisive step is needed, and therefore courage is needed for this, and yet marital love collapses into nothingness when this does not take place, because it is only thanks to this that one shows that one does not love oneself but the other. And how should one show if not thanks to the fact that one is only for another?» [129] . Consequently, the Danish philosopher maintains, «he became aware of the affront, and therefore of how unfortunate it is to want to love with a part of the soul but not with the whole, to reduce one's own love to a moment, and therefore to take all the love of another person» [130] .

91. Thus we find the foundation of monogamy precisely in the idea of person, which allows us at the same time to understand the meaning of our own existence and to love that of our spouse. The interior call to abandon ourselves before the other thus becomes the foundation of "loving only one" [131] . Kierkegaard himself confirms this when he recognizes that, if there is a true love that makes us go out of ourselves towards the other, "lovers are intimately convinced that their relationship is a perfect whole in itself" [132] . He also recognizes that this reality means for spouses a call to "transform the instant of enjoyment into a small eternity" [133] . This then implies the action of the spiritual will but above all the reference to God, without separating marriage – including its component of enjoyment and sexuality – from the love of God: «lovers refer their love to God» who effectively «will give it an absolute imprint of eternity» [134] .

92. These sources also nourish the personalism of Emmanuel Mounier, which starts from the «absolute value of the human person» [135] , whose full realisation can only come about through self-giving, in a process which transfigures all the tensions of the personality [136] . On the contrary, «constituted in a closed society, the family is made in the image of the individual proposed to it by the bourgeois world» [137] , and in this way constitutes only the sum of two particularisms, not a union. If its true nature is understood, «individuals must sacrifice their particularism to it […]. It is an adventure to be undertaken, a commitment to be made fruitful» [138] . But this is on condition that they strive towards it with all their effort . This totalising union is between two and does not admit rivals.

93. Also a supporter of personalism, Jean Lacroix draws inspiration more directly from Kierkegaard and expresses similar ideas under the figure of the mutual recognition of two people ( s'avouer l'un à l'autre ), which opens them to communion with all: «At the moment in which they recognize each other, the spouses simultaneously recognize each other before a superior reality that transcends them […]. The family, in fact, can undoubtedly be the place, the source and the archetype of all sociality […]. It will therefore be the analysis of recognition itself that will allow us to discern what is authentic and what is illusory in the conception of the family understood as the primary cell of society» [139] . The recognition of the other is «the human act that fully assumes the character of intimacy and the character of sociality», and in this way responds to the transcendental desire of love in its richest sense [140] . But it is a question of recognizing the other "as other" [141] . In this way, the tendency to fight against the other "is transformed into mutual recognition" [142] . In this horizon, we understand that the foundation of marriage "which is essentially love, cannot be anything other than integral recognition - recognition of the body, recognition of the soul, total recognition of this incarnate spirit which is the concrete man" [143] . Therefore, monogamy emerges clearly from the affirmation that marriage between a man and a woman is a "superior unity" to any other on this earth: "the family being is the greatest realization of human unity" [144] .

Face to face

94. The French philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas, with his reflection on the face of the other, proposes to always discover the personal relationship as a "face to face". Thanks to the face, which always imposes its own recognition, personal interiority becomes communicable and requires the ever new discovery of the other [145] . Sexual desire, when it moves within this dynamic of the face of the other, can adequately hold together sensitivity and transcendence, self-affirmation and recognition of otherness. In this face to face, the caress acts as an expression of love that seeks union by admiring, respecting and preserving otherness: "it is not an intention of unveiling but of research: a journey into the invisible" [146] . Lévinas's thought can be a fruitful way to explore the meaning of marriage as an exclusive union: a face-to-face relationship that is only possible between two people, and which, when fully realized, claims for itself an exclusive, mutual belonging, incommunicable and non-transferable outside of that "we two."

95. Polygamy, adultery, or polyamory are based on the illusion that the intensity of a relationship can be found in the succession of faces. As the myth of Don Juan illustrates, the number dissolves the name: it disperses the unity of the amorous impulse. If Lévinas showed that the face of the other summons an infinite, unique, and irreducible responsibility, multiplying faces in a supposedly total union means fragmenting the meaning of marital love.

The thought of Karol Wojtyła

96. Behind the well-known catechesis on love offered by Saint John Paul II as Pontiff, we can find the philosophical reflection developed by the young Bishop Karol Wojtyła. This reflection helps us to understand in depth the meaning of the unique and exclusive union of marriage.

97. The young Polish thinker takes the theme of this Note very seriously . He explains that marriage has «an interpersonal structure: it is a union and a community of two persons» [147] . This is «its essential character», «the interior and essential reason for being of marriage» which is «above all to constitute a union of two persons». This is its «integral value» which remains even beyond procreation [148] .

98. At the foundation of all his thought is what he himself calls the "personalist principle", which requires "treating the person in a way that corresponds to his being" and not "in the situation of an object of enjoyment, at the service of another person" [149] as happens in polygamy. Being a person necessarily implies that "he can never be an object of utilitarian enjoyment for another, but only an object (more exactly a co-subject) of love" [150] , because "he cannot be treated as an object of use, therefore as a means" [151] .

99. Wojtyła's thought allows us to understand why only monogamy guarantees that sexuality develops within a framework of recognition of the other as a subject with whom one shares one's life entirely, a subject who is an end in himself and never a means to one's own needs. Sexual union, which involves the whole person, can treat the other precisely as a person, that is, as a co-subject of love and not an object of use, only if it develops within the framework of a unique and exclusive belonging. In this case, those who give themselves fully and completely to the other can only be two . In any other case, it would be a partial gift of self, because such a gift must leave room for others, and consequently all would be treated as means and not as persons. For these reasons, he concludes that «strict monogamy is a manifestation of the personalist order» [152] .

100. In the same work, Karol Wojtyła broadens his reflection on monogamy with an original development on the unitive purpose of sexuality, which becomes an expression and a maturation of that objective fact which is marital unity as an essential property of marriage. For this reason, he forcefully denies the rigorist thesis – which he considers to be typical of “Manichean” or “ultra-spiritualist” visions – according to which «the Creator uses man and woman, as well as their sexual relations, to ensure the existence of the species homo . Thus he uses persons as means» [153] . Only in this context, for that mentality, would sexual pleasure become tolerable. Wojtyła instead maintains that «it is not at all incompatible with the objective dignity of persons that their conjugal love involves sexual “enjoyment” […]. There exists a joy which is in conformity with the nature of the sexual tendency and at the same time with the dignity of persons; in the vast field of love between man and woman, it springs from common action, from mutual understanding, from the harmonious fulfillment of goals chosen together. This joy, this enjoyment , can come both from the multifaceted pleasure created by the difference between the sexes and from the sexual voluptuousness offered by conjugal relations […] on condition that their love develops normally from the sexual impulse» [154] .

101. In his effort to avoid the rigorist extreme, which ultimately excludes the unitive finality of sexuality in marriage, Wojtyła explains that the other can be truly loved as a person and at the same time be fully desired. These two things "differ from each other, but not to the point of excluding each other" because "a person can desire another as a good for himself, but can at the same time desire something good for him, independently of the fact that it is also a good for himself" [155] . Recognizing the integrity of the person and his needs, it must also be admitted that mutual love requires many other expressions, not only sexuality: if "what the two people bring to love is solely, or above all, concupiscence in the search for enjoyment and pleasure, then reciprocity will be deprived of those characteristics" [156] which offer stability to marriage (love as a virtue, trust, disinterested giving, etc.).

Further on

102. The marriage of Jacques and Raïssa Maritain appears as a special case of intellectual, cultural and spiritual communion, which cannot be presented as the only model, since the forms of conjugal union are certainly as diverse as the people themselves. Their special case, however, has much to say. Given the wonderful experience of sharing with Raïssa an interior search for truth and above all for God, Jacques relativizes – without excluding it – the importance of desire, passion and sexuality: «The truth is this, in my opinion: first of all, love as desire or passion, and romantic love – or at least an element of it – should, as far as possible, be present in marriage as a first incentive, as a starting point […]. Secondly, marriage, far from having as its primary purpose that of bringing romantic love to its perfect fulfillment, has to accomplish a very different work in human hearts: an infinitely deeper and more mysterious operation of alchemy» [157] . He is fascinated by «a truly disinterested love, which does not exclude sex, of course, but which becomes increasingly independent of sex» [158] . He is not referring, in a Gnostic or Jansenist sense, to a spiritual love completely disconnected from corporeality or earthly realities, because such an interpretation would be contrary to his anthropological thought, but precisely to the ideal of «a complete and irrevocable gift of one to the other, for love of the other. Thus it is that marriage can be an authentic community of love between man and woman: something built not on sand, but on rock» [159] . This ideal of the full gift of oneself to the spouse implies «the arduous discipline of self-sacrifice and by dint of renunciations and purifications [...]. Each, in other words, can then become truly dedicated to the good and salvation of the other» [160] . In this context, he underlines the constant need for forgiveness: «prepared and ready, just as a guardian angel must be, to forgive others a lot: in fact the evangelical law of mutual forgiveness expresses well, it seems to me, a fundamental need» [161] .

103. In this text, Maritain's philosophical gaze is revealed as completely transfigured by a supernatural vision, where the power of theological love pushes the person who loves completely beyond himself, in search of the good of the other, to the fullness of this good of the beloved, which consists in his salvation, that is, in his total union with God. This profoundly spiritual vision of Maritain seems to exclude a complete philosophical treatment of marital love that we can find in other authors, but it has the great merit of guiding our reflection on monogamous love in an ascent towards the highest values, where such love matures in a self-sacrificing sense, which in marriage takes the form of a radical union . This admirable union manifests itself in the sincere and constant concern for the good of the other as a supernatural movement, and in the tender and generous search for the full and total fulfillment of the loved one in the saving love of God.

104. However, in a later text one can perceive a greater philosophical precision. These are the annotations that Maritain develops starting from his wife's diary , published after her death. They are annotations completed by Maritain himself and published separately [162] . Already in the first pages the theme of that very special love which reaches very high levels of generosity and disinterestedness returns. The French philosopher calls it «mad love» [163] , because it is a love «considered in its extreme and completely absolute form» [164] , characterised «by the power it has to alienate the soul from itself» [165] . But the novelty is that, in this commentary on Raïssa's diary , he takes a decisive step: he positively integrates sexuality even in the context of that most perfect love. Starting from human nature made of spirit and body and from the all-encompassing characteristic of marital love, he arrives at the affirmation: «a human person can give himself to another or be enraptured in another to the point of making this one his All, only if the other gives, or is willing to give, his body while giving his soul» [166] . In this supreme love between two human beings, marital unity finds its most precious earthly expression.  

Other views

105. It seems useful here to also keep in mind a glance at the non-Christian East. Let us dwell, for example, on the traditions of India. In that region, although monogamy has usually been the norm and considered an ideal in married life, polygamy has continued to be present over the centuries. In any case, one of the oldest texts taken from the Hindu scriptures, the Manusmṛti , states the following: "That mutual fidelity continues until death, this can be considered as the summary of the supreme law for husband and wife. That man and woman, united in marriage, constantly strive, that (they are) not disunited (and) do not violate their mutual fidelity" [167] . An important text that is often cited to defend monogamy is that of the Srimad Bhagavatam or Bhagavata Purana , which states: "Lord Rāmachandra vowed to accept only one wife and to have no ties with other women. He was a saintly king, and everything in his character was good, untainted by qualities such as anger» [168] . When Ravana kidnaps his wife Sita, Lord Ramachandra, who could have taken any other woman as his wife, takes none. Furthermore, the emphasis placed on the wife's chastity in the Thirukkural (a classical collection of aphorisms in Tamil) indicates the importance of total fidelity: «If woman could preserve chastity, what more precious treasure could the world contain? […] She who keeps incessant vigil to protect herself, takes care of her husband and the good name of her family, give her the name of a woman» [169] .

106. In connection with the philosophical and cultural reflections developed thus far, it is also appropriate to pay attention to the issue of education. Our era, in fact, is experiencing various trends regarding love: increasing divorce rates, the fragility of unions, the trivialization of adultery, and the promotion of polyamory. In light of all this, it must also be recognized that great collective narratives (novels, films, songs) continue to exalt the myth of the unique and exclusive "great love." The paradox is evident: social practices undermine what the imagination celebrates. This reveals that the desire for monogamous love remains inscribed deep within the human being, even when behaviors seem to deny it.

107. How, then, can we preserve the possibility of faithful and monogamous love? The answer lies in education. It is not enough to denounce failures; starting from the values still preserved in the popular imagination, we must prepare generations to embrace the experience of love as an anthropological mystery. The world of social networks , where modesty fades and symbolic and sexual violence proliferates, demonstrates the urgent need for a new pedagogy. Love cannot be reduced to an impulse: it always calls upon the responsibility and capacity for hope of the whole person. Engagement, understood in its traditional sense, embodies this time of testing and maturation, in which the other is welcomed as a promise of infinity. Thus, education in monogamy is not a moral constraint, but an initiation into the grandeur of a love that transcends immediacy. It directs erotic energy toward a wisdom of enduring and an openness to the divine. Monogamy is not archaism, but prophecy: it reveals that human love, lived in its fullness, somehow anticipates the very mystery of God.

 

V. The poetic word

108. Speaking of poetic words, Pope Francis states that "literary words are like a thorn in the heart that moves you to contemplation and sets you on the way. Poetry is open, it throws you elsewhere" [170] . And he adds: "The artist is the man who with his eyes looks and at the same time dreams, sees more deeply, prophesies, announces a different way of seeing and understanding the things that are before our eyes. Indeed, poetry does not speak of reality starting from abstract principles, but by listening to reality itself" [171] . Given these premises, it is impossible to ignore the poetic word in order to better grasp that mystery of love between two people who unite and belong to each other.

109. It is useful to note how many poets have sought to express the beauty of this unique and exclusive union. Acknowledging the power of their poetry now certainly does not imply that their lives were perfect or that they were always faithful in love. In any case, it is clear that, when they found love and decided to belong exclusively to another person, or when they perceived the value of an exclusive union, these poets needed to express it through their art, as if to indicate that it was something beyond sexual satisfaction, the fulfillment of a personal need, or a superficial adventure. Some examples include:

We drove around and around,
until we got home,
the two of us [172] .

No one else, my love, will sleep with my dreams.
You will go, we will go together across the waters of time… [173] .

110. In these verses, we perceive that, in a journey of respect and freedom, time consecrates the mutual choice, strengthens the bond, deepens the satisfaction of belonging to one another, enriches that "we" that comes to feel indestructible. In the context of this union, each of the two knows that, just as they have given something of themselves to the other, they have also received so much from their beloved:

I went down millions of stairs giving you my arm
not because perhaps one can see more with four eyes.
I went down them with you because I knew that
between us
the only true pupils, although so clouded,
were yours [174] .

I give you myself,
my sleepless nights,
the long sips
of sky and stars – drunk
on the mountains,
the breeze of the seas crossed
towards remote dawns . […]
And you welcome my wonder
as a creature,
my trembling as a
living stem in the circle
of horizons,
bent to the
clear wind – of beauty:
and you let me look at these eyes
that God has given you,
so full of sky –
deep as centuries of light
sunk beyond
the peaks – [175]

111. The relationship is seen as irreplaceable, so that, when the poet wants to rediscover his roots, he conceives of himself as referring to the other person, with a force that transcends time:

I will close my eyes
and I only want five things,
five favorite roots.
One is endless love…
The fifth thing is your eyes
, my beloved Matilda,
I don't want to sleep without your eyes,
I don't want to be without you looking at me [176] .

112. In great poets one generally does not find a naive romanticism, but a realism that recognizes the risks of static habituation, accepts the challenges that stimulate growth, and at the same time does not lose sight of the need for an openness outside the narrow circle of the two:

The two of us holding hands
We believe ourselves to be at home everywhere [...]
Next to wise men and fools
Among children and adults [177] . 

113. This is rooted in the fact that the authenticity of this union excludes any form of self-contained fusion. Mutual belonging is not merely the fruit of personal need, but of a decision to belong to the other that allows us to overcome loneliness and abandonment: a decision that is simultaneously intimately marked by great respect for the other and for his or her personal mystery. Love, which sees in the other a unique value, perceives in its own way that the human person is "non-transferable," that it cannot be its own property, and requires a similar attitude:

Your eyes question me sadly.
They would like to probe all my thoughts
while the moon scans the sea [...]
But it is my heart, my love.
Its joys and its anxieties
are immense
and its desires and its riches are infinite.
This heart is as close to you as your own life,
but you cannot know it completely [178] .

114. In these few examples cited, it clearly emerges how the poetic word takes seriously the value of the exclusive union of two people who have freely decided to be together and to belong, in an exclusive way, to each other. What has been said about the all-encompassing nature of love can be summarised with the words of another great poet, Emily Dickinson: « That Love is all / is all we know of Love » [179] .

 

VI. Some reflections to be explored further

115. Thanks to the progress made thus far, it is now possible to gather a substantial body of considerations that can help us perceive the unique and exclusive marital union in a harmonious and multifaceted way. These considerations are in themselves useful for a valid understanding of the meaning of monogamy; however, it seems appropriate, in this final part of the Note , to focus attention on some important specific points regarding the theme under consideration. As we have seen, the unity-union of marriage could be expressed in various philosophical, theological, or poetic ways, but among the many possible ones, two appear decisive: mutual belonging and conjugal charity. Both have emerged frequently in various texts cited in this Note .

Mutual belonging

116. One way of expressing this exclusive union between two people is summed up in the expression "mutual belonging." Already in the fifth century, Saint Leo the Great referred to the mutual belonging of spouses when he spoke of the situation of soldiers who, presumed dead, return from war and discover that they have been "replaced" by others. The Pope then orders that "each should receive what belongs to him . " [180] This insight now leads us to reflect on this mutual belonging in a richer and deeper way.

117. It is St. Thomas Aquinas who affirms that, to establish a friendship, "not even benevolence is enough, but mutual love is required " [181] . Mutual belonging is based on the free consent of the two. Indeed, in the Latin rite of marriage, consent is expressed by saying: "I accept you as my bride", "I accept you as my husband" [182] . In this regard, following the dictates of the Second Vatican Council , it must be said that consent is a "human act by which the spouses mutually give and receive each other" [183] . This act "which binds the spouses to each other" [184] is a giving and receiving of one another: it is the dynamism which gives rise to mutual belonging, called to deepen, to mature, to become ever more solid. In technical terms, mutual giving is the matter ; mutual acceptance is the form .

118. It is no coincidence that Saint Paul VI links the " mutual personal gift" in marriage to the unity of the bond, characterizing it as "their own and exclusive ". [185] And, still on the subject of reciprocity, Karol Wojtyła maintains that it "obliges us to consider the love of man and woman not only as the love of one for the other but rather as something that exists between them [...]. Love is not only in the woman nor only in the man – because then we would ultimately have two loves – but it is unique, it is that thing which binds them [...]. Its being, in its fullness, is inter-personal and not individual [...]. It is reciprocity which, in love, decides the birth of this 'we'. It proves that love has matured, has become something between persons, has created a community" [186] . This reciprocity is a reflection of the Trinitarian life: "two persons whom a perfect love brings together in unity. This movement and this love make them similar to God, who is the same love, the absolute unity of the three Persons" [187] . The unity of the relationship of the spouses is profoundly rooted in Trinitarian communion.

119. Pope Francis loved to speak of marriage in terms of freely chosen belonging, because "without a sense of belonging , one cannot sustain dedication to others; each ends up seeking only his or her own convenience." [188] In marriage, each of the two "expresses the firm decision to belong to one another. Getting married is a way of expressing that one has truly left the maternal nest to forge other strong bonds and take on a new responsibility towards another person. This is much more important than a mere spontaneous association for mutual gratification." [189] Mutual and exclusive belonging becomes a strong motivation for the stability of the union: "In marriage, one also experiences the sense of belonging completely to one person. The spouses take on the challenge and the yearning to grow old and live out their lives together and thus reflect God's faithfulness [...]. It is a belonging of the heart , where only God sees (cf.  Mt  5:28). Every morning when we get up, we renew this decision of faithfulness before God, whatever happens during the day. And each one, when he goes to sleep, waits to get up to continue this adventure" [190] .

The transformation

120. With the passage of time, even when physical attraction and the possibility of sexual relations weaken, mutual belonging is not destined to dissolve. The option for the union of the two changes and transforms. Naturally, various intimate expressions of affection will not be lacking, which, however, are also considered exclusive, as expressions of the unique marital union, which cannot be offered to others without experiencing inadequacy. Precisely because the experience of mutual and exclusive belonging has deepened and strengthened over time, there are expressions that are reserved only for the person with whom one has chosen to share one's heart in a unique way.

121. For Pope Francis , this is precisely one of the advantages of understanding the marital union as a mutual belonging: «The intimate relationship and mutual belonging must be maintained for four, five or six decades, and this entails the need to re-choose one another repeatedly. Perhaps the spouse is no longer attracted by an intense sexual desire that moves him or her towards the other person, but he or she feels the pleasure of belonging to that person and that that person belongs to him or her , of knowing that he or she is not alone, of having an 'accomplice' who knows everything about his or her life and who shares everything. This is the companion on the journey of life» [191] . Thus «although many confused feelings circulate in the heart, the decision to love, to belong to one another , to share one's entire life and to continue to love and forgive one another remains alive every day […]. In the course of this journey, love celebrates each step and each new stage […]. The bond finds new modalities and demands the decision to re-establish it over and over again. Not only to preserve it, but to make it grow" [192] . In any case, it must be recognized that mutual belonging is a way of understanding the conjugal union which has its great richness and at the same time limits which it is essential to clarify.

Non-belonging

122. A characteristic of the person is that he is an end in himself. The human being "is the only creature on earth that God willed for its own sake" [193] . It can thus be said that man is an end in himself , and therefore cannot be reduced to being merely the end of others. The person cannot be treated in a way that does not correspond to this dignity, which can be called "infinite" [194] , both because of the unlimited love that God has for him and because it is an absolutely inalienable dignity. Every "human individual has the dignity of a  person ; he is not just something, but someone" [195] . Consequently, the person "cannot be treated as an object of use, and therefore as a means" [196] .

123. When this conviction, proper to true love that stops short of the sacred dimension of the other, is lacking, the diseases of undue possession of the other easily develop: manipulation, jealousy, harassment, infidelity. On the other hand, the mutual belonging proper to mutual exclusive love implies delicate care, a holy fear of profaning the freedom of the other, who has the same dignity and therefore the same rights. Those who love know that the other cannot be a means of resolving their own dissatisfaction; they know that their own emptiness must be filled in other ways, never through domination of the other. This is what does not happen in many forms of unhealthy desire, which result in various manifestations of explicit or subtle violence, oppression, psychological pressure, control, and ultimately asphyxiation. This lack of respect and reverence for the dignity of the other is also found in those claims of complementarity where one of the two is forced to develop only some of his or her possibilities, while the other finds ample room for personal expansion. To avoid all this, it must be recognized that there is no single model of marital reciprocity. In a healthy and generous relationship "there are flexible roles and tasks, which adapt to the concrete circumstances of each family" [197] . Consequently, "at home decisions are not made unilaterally, and the two share responsibility for the family, but every home is unique and every marital synthesis is different" [198] .

124. When, instead of a healthy mutual belonging – even though this always requires patience and generosity – signs of irritation and even some disrespect appear in the spouse, it is necessary to react in time before forms of manipulation or violence appear. In these cases, the person must assert his or her dignity, set the necessary limits and begin a journey of sincere dialogue, in such a way as to express a clear message: "You do not possess me, you do not dominate me". And this not only to defend oneself, but also for the dignity of the other, because "in the logic of domination, even those who dominate end up denying their own dignity" [199] .

125. The healthy and beautiful "two of us" can only be the reciprocity of two freedoms that are never violated, but choose each other, always leaving a safe limit that cannot be exceeded, that cannot be crossed with the excuse of some need, personal anxiety or psychological state. As Pope Francis highlights , spouses "are called to an ever more intense union, but the risk lies in trying to erase the differences and that inevitable distance that exists between the two. Because each possesses a dignity that is proper and unrepeatable" [200] . Fully respecting this principle "requires an interior stripping" [201] .

126. Taking what has been said so far seriously, the word "belonging" can only be applied to marriage in a similar way. Indeed, any form of belonging other than that of a love that experiences the other as sacred in their freedom, not transferable to its personal core, and autonomous, would only be a self-centered way of subjecting the spouse to one's own ends or plans. The person does not disperse in the relationship, does not merge with the loved one, always remaining an untransferable core. This should not be understood as a limitation or a poverty of mutual love; on the contrary, it allows for the preservation of that level of respect and wonder that are part of every healthy love, which never intends to absorb the other.

127. This is confirmed by the fact that there is a dimension of the person which, being the deepest, transcends all others – including the corporeal – and which only God can enter without violating it. There is a core of the human being in which only the infinite love of God can reign. He alone has the omnipotent and creative love which makes the very existence of freedom possible. Therefore, if he touches it, he can only strengthen it, promote it, exalt it in its very nature, without any possibility of mutilating it, dominating it, weakening it or imposing himself upon it. Indeed, "God alone penetrates [ illabitur ] the soul" [202] : only God can enter into the depths of the human heart, since only he can do so without disturbing the freedom and identity of the person [203] . God, through grace, draws fully close, with an identification with the deepest depths of the human being which only he can reach [204] . Therefore, "no one can claim to possess the most personal and secret intimacy of the loved one" [205] .

128. As their love matures, the couple will be able to peacefully understand and accept that the precious mutual belonging that characterizes marriage is not a possession, but leaves open many possibilities. For example, one of the two may request a moment of reflection, or some habitual space for solitude or autonomy, or reject the other's intrusion into some aspect of their intimacy, or keep some personal secrets locked away in the sanctum sanctorum of their conscience without being followed or observed.

129. When love matures, that "we two" possesses all the strength of a union freely chosen by both, all the joy of a shared memory, all the satisfaction of a shared journey and dreams, all the security that comes from knowing that one is not and will not be alone. But that beauty is enhanced by a magnificent freedom that no true love could harm.

130. Marriage, therefore, also excludes any control that might provide security, absolute certainty, the absence of all surprises. In a mature love, if the other needs time to rediscover the world, there is room only for trust, not for the demand for absolute tranquility, free of all secret fears, incapable of facing new challenges. In this sense, marriage does not free us completely from loneliness, because a spouse cannot attain a space that can only be God's, nor fill a personal emptiness that no human being is capable of filling. The fact that their affection is imperfect does not mean that it is false, totally selfish, inauthentic, but simply that it is earthly, limited, and cannot be expected to satisfy every need.

Mutual aid

131. Certainly, this ability to accept the risk of freedom does not mean that a spouse who is very sensitive to defending his or her own space for autonomy will cultivate an indifference to the other's fears, an excessive self-confidence, a demand for complete independence that the limited human heart of his or her partner, especially if he or she loves him or her, cannot accept without great suffering. He or she cannot feel saved by his or her own autonomous self-sufficiency, because a loving alliance also implies the recognition that the other person needs him or her.

132. Together with safeguarding a healthy freedom, the word of God, while approving the request for spaces of autonomy and solitude for a certain period, also demands: "Do not reject one another" ( 1 Cor 7:5). When distance becomes too frequent, the "we" is exposed to its own possible eclipse, to the weakening of the other's desire. In any case, if mutual attraction wanes, it is always possible to find space for sincere dialogue to heal what is causing the mutual estrangement. Ultimately, it is always possible to seek alternative paths that consolidate and enrich the "we" in a new way. This is a healthy but difficult balance, which each couple achieves in its own way , through sincere dialogue and mutual offering.

133. Mutual belonging becomes mutual help, help that not only seeks the happiness of the spouse and an alleviation of his or her suffering, but also helps each other to mature as persons, until reaching the ultimate end of life for both before God, at the banquet of heaven. Saint Paul VI recalls that "through the mutual personal gift, proper and exclusive to them, spouses tend towards the communion of their persons, by which they perfect each other " [206] . Prayer as a couple is certainly a precious means for growing in love and for sanctifying one another, a prayer which "has as its original content family life itself" [207] . In this journey of sanctification, says Sertillanges, sexuality must not be excluded, lived as a holy expression of a full gift of self to the other, as Christ and his Church give themselves to each other: "The act thus performed is therefore not only licit as the effect of a natural and legal institution; not only is it virtuous, as useful and directed to useful ends; it is holy with the sanctity of the sacrament of which it is the use, with the sanctity of the sacred union of all humanity with its Redeemer» [208] .

134. A discussion of monogamy implies the recognition of the fact that the uniqueness of the spouse reflects, in the “horizontal” order of human relationships, the uniqueness of the relationship of the human person with the divine Infinite. Thinking about monogamy means questioning the relationship of human love with its ultimate fulfillment. Every loving relationship silently calls for the presence of an infinite Third, who is God himself . [209] Without this Third, love easily closes in on itself and collapses. Conjugal exclusivity then appears not as a limitation, but as the condition of possibility of a supernatural love which, beyond the flesh, opens itself to the eternal. Indeed, St. Thomas Aquinas teaches that the same “Holy Spirit proceeds invisibly to the soul through the gift of love.” [210] Consequently, in the experience of authentic love we connect with that infinite Love which is the Holy Spirit. Precisely the experience of such a close love, like that of marriage, powerfully awakens in the human heart the desire for a love that is not only forever, but without end. Thus, the love of spouses becomes an epiphany of the transcendent and eternal destiny of the human person. For only a love capable of transcending human love, an eternal and infinite Love, can respond to that desire for love "forever" and "without end" that conjugal love inspires. And this is why the experience of that particular and profound closeness , offered by the conjugal bond, is ultimately destined to awaken in the heart of every man and every woman the desire for that unparalleled closeness that only God can offer fully and definitively. And God himself, by becoming man, begins to respond to this desire, also conferring on the closeness born of the marital bond the seal of uniqueness, which is precisely the sign and pledge of God's communion with each of us in a covenant of never-ending love. Consequently, how can we not think of marriage as a path of mutual help to sanctify ourselves together, to reach the heights of union with God?

135. Mutual help for sanctification, in which the two support each other "in grace" [211] , is achieved above all in the exercise of conjugal charity, because only charity exercised concretely towards the other allows us to grow in the life of grace, and without charity any effort at sanctification "would be of no use to me" ( 1 Cor 13:3). For this reason, the last pages of this document are dedicated to that unitive power which is conjugal charity.

Conjugal charity

136. We have already discussed the reciprocal nature of the conjugal union, which can be considered a form of intimate and all-encompassing friendship. In this regard, it is useful to remember that St. Thomas himself specifies that friendship is "founded on some commonality" [212] . More than some ideological or aesthetic affinities, which can be very important, it is a question of the communion that creates love, which with its unitive force makes spouses similar to each other, increases the things they share, creates a treasure of life between the two. Therefore, first of all, it must be said that, in order to speak of friendship, there must be love.

A particular form of friendship

137. Marriage cannot be properly understood without speaking of love, which for Christians is always called to reach the heights of charity, the supernatural love which "bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things" ( 1 Cor 13:7). Indeed, "the grace proper to the sacrament of Matrimony is intended to perfect the love of the spouses" [213] . This supernatural love is a divine gift, which is asked for in prayer and nourished in the sacramental life, and invites spouses to remember the fact that God is the principal author of the unity of marriage, and that without his help their union will never reach its fullness. When the Latin rite of marriage quotes the words of the Lord: "What God has joined together, let no man separate" [214] (cf. Mt 19:6; Mk 10:9), we note that conjugal unity is not constituted only by human consent, but is the work of the Holy Spirit. The same must be said of the growth in communion of spouses, animated by grace and charity. This communion develops as a response to a "vocation from God and is brought about as a filial response to his call" [215] . But the growth of charity does not occur without human cooperation: in this case, the collaboration of spouses who seek every day an ever more intense, rich and generous communion. 

138. Charity – including conjugal charity – is an affective union, meaning here by “affective” something more than feelings and desires: «it implies an affective bond between the one who loves and the thing loved: insofar as the one who loves considers the loved person as one with himself» [216] . It is expressed in the action of the will [217] which wants, chooses someone, decides to enter into intimate communion with him, unites himself to that person freely, with all the more or less intense effects that this may imply on the sensitivity in the form of desire, emotions, sexual attraction, sensuality. Even when these effects on the sensitivity or on the body weaken or are transformed in the various phases of life, the affective union remains, sometimes with great intensity, in the will. It is the will that wants to remain in union with the other human being, appreciating him as of «great value» [218]   and constituting with him «one thing with himself» [219] .

139. Only in this way is it possible to sustain fidelity in times of adversity or temptation, because charity keeps us attached to a value higher than the satisfaction of personal needs. In this regard, we cannot ignore the many testimonies of couples in which the spouses have supported each other in the various difficulties of life, sometimes during trials lasting years, thus testifying to the prophetic importance of monogamy. This is well expressed in the formula of consent in the Latin rite of marriage: "I promise to be faithful to you always, in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, and to love and honour you all the days of my life" [220] . Conjugal charity itself, with its unitive power, makes it possible for this promise to be truly fulfilled. This affective, faithful and total union takes the form of friendship in marriage, because ultimately charity is a form of friendship [221] . And Pope Francis , quoting St. Thomas Aquinas, therefore maintains that "after the love that unites us to God, conjugal love is the 'greatest friendship'" [222] . 

140. In the Old Testament there is a peremptory affirmation referring to the need to love: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself" ( Lev 19:18). This affirmation comes at the end of a passage in which the obligations of the pious Israelite towards those who are his "neighbor" are continually recalled. This is a very well-known affirmation, since Jesus takes it up and reiterates it (cf. Mt 22:39; Mk 12:31; Lk 10:29-37). He thus establishes a very special link between the reality of love, such a universal phenomenon, and the category of "neighbor." In this way, love itself, when it is authentic, not only is directed towards those who are close to us, but is also capable of generating a "closeness." It follows that the "neighbor" is someone with whom a particular sharing of life takes place. In this sense, conjugal love itself reveals and embodies a special "closeness," which makes the commandment's content resonate with particular conviction. Spousal love, in fact, creates and evokes a unique and singular closeness between two loving hearts, generating a special affinity nourished by such a sharing of self, of goods, and of life as a whole, that the depth of conjugal love is capable of realizing with unparalleled intensity. As love matures and grows, in marriage the heart of the beloved realizes that no other heart is capable of making it feel "at home" like that of the person it loves.

In body and soul

141. This conjugal friendship, filled with mutual knowledge, appreciation of the other, complicity, intimacy, understanding and patience, seeking the good of the other, and sensitive gestures, to the extent that it transcends sexuality, at the same time embraces it and gives it its most beautiful, profound, unitive and fruitful meaning. In this regard, Pope Francis recalls that "God himself created sexuality, which is a marvelous gift" [223] . At the same time, "sexual union, lived in a human way and sanctified by the sacrament, is in turn for the spouses a path of growth in the life of grace" [224] . Therefore, placing sexuality within the proper framework of a love that unites spouses in a single friendship, which seeks the good of the other, does not imply a devaluation of sexual pleasure. By directing it towards the gift of self, it is not only enriched but can also be strengthened. St. Thomas Aquinas explains all this very well when he recalls that "nature has linked pleasure to the functions necessary for the life of man" and that whoever rejected it, "to the point of neglecting what is necessary for the conservation of nature, would commit a sin, thus violating the natural order. And it is precisely this that falls within the vice of insensibility" [225] . Within this logic, St. Thomas argues that, before original sin, sensible pleasure was greater, since nature was purer, more whole, and consequently the body was more sensitive. This is the opposite of anxious dissoluteness which ultimately damages pleasure by depriving it of the possibilities of an authentically human experience [226] . The specifically human capacities that allow the human spirit to permeate the senses, to direct them and bring them to completion, "do not diminish the pleasure of the senses", but rather to make it possible in all its fullness and richness, preventing "the concupiscible faculty from adhering unrestrainedly to pleasure" [227] . Living sexuality as an action of the whole human being, in his corporeality and interiority, thanks also to the transfiguring power of charity, means that it is not lived passively, as a simple letting oneself be carried away by impulses, but as the action of the person who chooses to unite fully with the other.

142. Lived in this way, sexuality is no longer the outlet for an immediate need, but a personal choice that expresses the totality of one's person and accepts the other as a personal totality. This truth, rather than compromising the intensity of pleasure, can increase it, making it more intense, richer and more fulfilling. The mere fact of being treated as a person, and of treating the other in the same way, can free the heart from traumas, fears, anguish, anxiety, feelings of loneliness, abandonment, and the inability to love, which certainly hinder pleasure. At the same time, the development of love as a human and theological virtue helps to liberate the best of each person in his or her unique identity, and thus make him or her capable of a greater and more human joy, to the point of giving thanks to God who created everything "for our enjoyment" ( 1 Tim 6:17). All this does not take away from sexual union that "abundance of pleasure which is in the sexual act ordered according to reason" and which "does not contradict the means of virtue" [228] . Instead, if one withdraws into oneself and one's immediate needs, and uses the other as the only means for their release, the pleasure leaves one more unsatisfied and the feeling of emptiness and loneliness becomes more bitter. 

143. Speaking of conjugal charity, Karol Wojtyła invites us to overcome every useless dialectic, explaining that «love-virtue refers to effective love as well as to the love of concupiscence» [229] . Pope Benedict XVI , in Deus caritas est , reiterates that oblative love ( amor benevolentiae ) and possessive love ( amor concupiscentiae ) cannot be separated from each other, because «ultimately 'love' is a single reality, albeit with different dimensions; from time to time, one or the other dimension can emerge more. Where, however, the two dimensions are completely detached from each other, a caricature or in any case a reductive form of love emerges» [230] . When we speak of concupiscence, we must not only mean sexual desire, but also any way of seeking the other as "a good for me," to overcome loneliness, to receive help in difficulties, to have a space of total trust, etc. This form of love, which is not excluded in marriage, is a way of expressing that I am not the savior of the other, an omnipotent and inexhaustible giver of good, but that I am a needy being, that I too need the other, that I too am incomplete and fragile, and that therefore the other is important to me and I give him the possibility of becoming fruitful by doing good to me. To do otherwise would be a sort of self-sufficiency that can easily be transformed into disguised egocentrism, because Satan "disguises himself as an angel of light" ( 2 Cor 11:14). Benedict XVI thus explains that "man cannot even live exclusively in self-sacrificing, descending love. He cannot always just give, he must also receive. Whoever wants to give love must himself receive it as a gift" [231] .

144. In this sense, we cannot ignore the fact that in recent decades, in the context of postmodern consumerist individualism, various problems have emerged, originating from an excessive and uncontrolled pursuit of sex, or from the simple denial of the procreative purpose of sexuality. A characteristic of recent decades is the explicit denial of the unitive purpose of sexuality and of marriage itself. This occurs especially because of the feeling of anxiety, of being constantly busy, of wanting more free time for oneself, of being constantly obsessed with traveling and exploring other realities. Consequently, the desire for emotional exchange, for sexual relations themselves, but also for dialogue and cooperation, disappears, all of which are seen as "stressful."

The multifaceted fruitfulness of love

145. An integral vision of conjugal charity does not deny its fruitfulness, the possibility of generating a new life, because "this totality, required by conjugal love, also corresponds to the demands of a responsible fruitfulness" [232] . Sexual union, as a way of expressing conjugal charity, must naturally remain open to the communication of life [233] , even if this does not mean that this must be an explicit aim of every sexual act. In fact, three legitimate situations can arise:

a) That a couple cannot have children. Karol Wojtyła explains this magnificently when he recalls that marriage has «an interpersonal structure, it is a union and a community of two persons […]. For many reasons, marriage may not become a family, but the lack of this does not deprive it of its essential character. In fact, the interior and essential reason for the existence of marriage is not only to transform itself into a family, but above all to constitute a union of two persons, a lasting union founded on love […]. A marriage in which there are no children, through no fault of the spouses, retains the integral value of the institution […] it loses none of its importance» [234] .

b) That a couple does not consciously seek a certain sexual act as a means of procreation. Wojtyła also says this, maintaining that a conjugal act, which « being in itself an act of love that unites two persons, may not necessarily be considered by them as a conscious and desired means of procreation » [235] .

c) That a couple respect the natural times of infertility. Following this line of reflection, as Saint Paul VI states , «the Church teaches that it is then licit to take into account the natural rhythms inherent in the generative functions for the use of marriage only in the infertile periods» [236] . This can serve not only to «regulate birth rates», but also to choose the most suitable moments to welcome a new life. In the meantime, the couple can exploit these periods «as a manifestation of affection and to safeguard mutual fidelity. In doing so they give proof of a love that is truly and completely honest» [237] .

146. All this shows the important innovation that Pope Pius XI offers when he affirms that conjugal love "pervades all the duties of conjugal life and in Christian marriage holds the primacy of nobility" [238] . In this way, he helps to overcome the discussion on the relationship between the ends or meanings of marriage (procreative and unitive) and the order that exists between them, placing conjugal charity above this dialectic of ends and goods as the central question of conjugal life, which in turn gives it a multifaceted fruitfulness. Even in the most difficult moments, spouses can say: "We are friends, we love each other, we value each other, we have decided to share our entire lives, we belong to each other, and we have freely chosen this union that God himself has blessed and strengthened. If at one time there are no children, we remain united and are fruitful in other ways; if at one time there is no sex, we continue to live this unique, exclusive, and all-encompassing friendship, which is also our best path to growth and sanctification."

147. St. Augustine himself, who so strongly emphasizes the purpose of procreation, teaches that marriage in itself is a good even if there are no children, "because it establishes a natural partnership between the two sexes. Otherwise it would not continue to be called marriage even in old people, especially when they have lost their children or have had none at all" [239] . A similar position, expressed in other words, is supported by St. John Chrysostom: "What then is to be said: if there is no child, then [the spouses] will no longer be two? It is evident: their joining ( míxis ) in fact does just this, it pours and mixes together the bodies of both. And as he who has poured perfume into oil makes the whole one, so also here" [240] . In essence, this is also affirmed by the Second Vatican Council: "Even if the offspring, often so keenly desired, do not arise, marriage endures as a custom and communion of the whole of life and retains its value" [241] .

148. One author illustrates well that, beyond the "objectives" that spouses may set for themselves, which do not constitute the essence of marriage, "the union-unity that marriage entails is explained and justified in itself, with priority given to its teleological tension, because it is a union-unity that possesses in itself its own and complete reason for good, from which certain proper works derive, without a doubt, but as consequences, never as causes" [242] . Of this union-unity, which belongs to the essence of marriage, conjugal charity is the principal and most perfect moral and spiritual expression that gives marriage various forms of fruitfulness.

A friendship open to all

149. From what has been said, it follows that an exclusive union generated and sustained by true love, even if still immature and fragile, cannot be closed in on itself; it is not an extension of individualism in the life of a couple, but is open to other relationships, is disposed to the couple's self-giving, and to shared projects to do something beautiful for the community and for the world.

150. If marriage is already in itself a framework for a relationship which matures both spouses, this is even more true when it is generously open to others, thus overcoming "the original tragic closure of man within himself" [243] which leads to the thought that by isolating himself a person is freer and happier. Because "the human creature, insofar as he is spiritual by nature, finds fulfilment in interpersonal relationships. The more authentically he lives them, the more his own personal identity also matures. It is not by isolating himself that man fulfils himself, but by placing himself in relation with others and with God" [244] .

151. As Pope Francis teaches in his appeal for universal brotherhood in his Encyclical Fratelli tutti , charity is called to an intensive but also extensive growth, which "tends to embrace everyone" . [245] Charity, therefore, impels us to broaden the conjugal "we": "I cannot reduce my life to relationships with a small group, or even to my family, because it is impossible to understand myself without a broader fabric of relationships [...]. The bond of a couple and of friendship is designed to open our hearts to others, to enable us to go beyond ourselves to welcome everyone. Closed groups and self-referential couples, which constitute themselves as an "we" opposed to the entire world, are usually idealized forms of selfishness and mere self-protection" . [246]

152. The risk of "endogamy," that is, of a closed "we," contradicts the very nature of charity and can mortally wound it. Four factors can prevent this "endogamy," which distorts and impoverishes the meaning of the conjugal union:

a) The spaces each spouse enjoys through work, personal endeavors, and learning and development opportunities outside of marriage. If one spouse is unemployed, it becomes necessary to create these spaces for the benefit of the marriage, enriching dialogue and the relationship in general.

b) The procreative meaning of marriage, which manifests the fruitfulness of love that is not closed to the communication of life. For those unable to have children, adoption or other forms of stable support for the children of other couples can be a way to realize this fruitfulness.

c) Time spent with other married friends, during which, while learning from each other's experiences and receiving support, there is a constant willingness to lend a hand in difficult times, while at the same time helping the couple to become aware of themselves as a union through friendship with other couples.

d) The social sense of the couple, who, faithful to the social dimension of Christian life, seeks ways to render a service to society and the Church, committing themselves together to the search for the common good: «Even the family with many children is called to leave its mark on the society in which it is inserted, to develop other forms of fruitfulness which are like the extension of the love which sustains it […]. It does not remain waiting, but goes out of itself in a search of solidarity» [247] . «Social love, a reflection of the Trinity, is in reality what unifies the spiritual sense of the family and its mission outside itself» [248] .

153. A particular proof of the openness of the couple's friendship towards others and of the fruitfulness of their charity is shown in their attention to the poor. Indeed, as Pope Leo XIV recalls , "the Christian cannot consider the poor only as a social problem: they are a 'family question'. They are 'one of us'" [249] . Furthermore, "love for those who are poor – in whatever form this poverty manifests itself – is the evangelical guarantee of a Church faithful to the heart of God" [250] . This fact is reflected in one of the options for the final blessing in the Latin rite of marriage, which concludes with the prayer: "Be witnesses of God's love in the world so that the poor and the suffering, who have experienced your charity, may one day gratefully welcome you into the house of the Father" [251] .

 

VII. Conclusion

154. Ultimately, although each spousal union is a unique reality, embodied within human limitations, every authentic marriage is a unity composed of two individuals, requiring a relationship so intimate and all-encompassing that it cannot be shared with others . At the same time, since it is a union between two persons who have exactly the same dignity and the same rights, it demands that exclusivity which prevents the other from being relativized in his or her unique value and used merely as a means among others for the satisfaction of needs. This is the truth of monogamy that the Church reads in Scripture when she affirms that from two they become "one flesh." It is the first essential and inalienable characteristic of that very particular friendship which is marriage, and which requires as its existential manifestation an all-encompassing relationship – spiritual and corporeal – which matures and grows ever more towards a union that reflects the beauty of Trinitarian communion and of the union between Christ and his beloved People. This occurs to such an extent that we can recognize "in the intimate conjugal union, through which two people become one heart, one soul, one flesh, the first original meaning of marriage" [252] .

155. The path followed in this Note now allows us to highlight a development of Christian thought on marriage, from antiquity to the present day, where it is evident that of its two essential properties – unity and indissolubility – unity is the founding property . On the one hand, because indissolubility derives as a characteristic of a unique and exclusive union. On the other, because unity-union, accepted and lived with all its consequences, makes possible the permanence and fidelity that indissolubility demands. Indeed, various magisterial documents have described the marital union simply as an "indissoluble unity " [253] .

156. This union requires a constant growth of love: "marital love is not safeguarded primarily by speaking of indissolubility as if it were an obligation, or by repeating a doctrine, but by strengthening it through constant growth under the impulse of grace. Love that does not grow begins to run risks, and we can grow only by responding to divine grace through more acts of love, with more frequent, more intense, more generous, more tender, more joyful acts of affection" [254] . Marital unity is not only a reality that must be ever better understood in its most beautiful sense, but also a dynamic reality, called to continuous development. As the Second Vatican Council affirms, husband and wife "experience the sense of their own unity and achieve it ever more fully " [255] . For "the best is that which has not yet been achieved, the wine matured with time" [256] .

[3] The Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM) has undertaken to draft a report for the Synod of Bishops on the challenges of polygamy. While awaiting this document, it seems appropriate to note that, according to a common opinion, monogamous marriage in Africa should be considered an exceptional fact, given the widespread practice of polygamy in those regions. However, in-depth studies on African cultures show that the different traditions attribute special importance to the first marriage between a man and a woman and, above all, to the role that the first wife is called to play in relation to the other wives. Indeed, research indicates rather that polygamy is a practice tolerated because of the necessities of life (absence of children, levirate, labor for survival, etc.). Many traditions in fact promote the monogamous model as the ideal of marriage that corresponds to divine plans. The first wife, regularly married according to traditional customs, is often presented as the one given to the man by God, although the latter may adopt other women. In the case of polygamy, the first wife is accorded a special place in performing sacred funeral rites or in raising children born to other women in the family. It is interesting to note that, in recent decades, in some states, the civil legislator has established monogamy as an ordinary marital regime (cf. Société Africaine de Culture, Les religions africaines comme source de valeurs de civilisation. Colloque de Cotonou, 16-22 août 1970 , Présence Africaine, Paris 1972; Isidore de Souza, «Mariage et famille», in Revue de l'Institut Catholique de l'Afrique de l'Ouest 5-6 [1993], 164; Id., «Notion et réalité de la famille en Afrique et dans la Bible», in Savanes Forêts 30 [1984], 145-146).

The sacrament as such belongs totally to the mystery of the Church into which they are introduced, in a privileged way, by their conjugal love» ( International Theological Commission , The Catholic Doctrine on the Sacrament of Matrimony [1977], B.
