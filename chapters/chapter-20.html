Presentation

This is a text for the universal Church, yet it can be duly considered in every place in the face of local cultural challenges. The document, in fact, takes seriously the current global context of the development of technological power, in which human beings are tempted to think of themselves as limitless creatures, capable of achieving anything they imagine. In this way, the value of an exclusive love, reserved for a single person, is easily obscured, which in itself implies the free renunciation of many other possibilities.

In truth, the intention of this Note is fundamentally propositional: to extract from the Sacred Scriptures, from the history of Christian thought, from philosophy and even from poetry, reasons and motivations that push us to choose a unique and exclusive union of love, a rich and all-encompassing mutual belonging.

This effort will enrich reflection and teaching on marriage with an aspect that has so far been underdeveloped. At the same time, it could provide varied and useful material for marriage movements and groups for study and dialogue. This explains the length of the Note  and the number of authors and texts cited. Some may find this selection excessive, but we believe that each of the authors and texts cited can provide nuances and nuances that stimulate serene reflection and sustained study.

We will consider the most important works of the Magisterium and a series of authors from ancient to recent times: theologians, philosophers, and poets. We have found a wealth of reflections that emphasize the union of spouses, reciprocity, and the all-encompassing meaning of the marital relationship. Thus, the various texts will compose a beautiful mosaic that will surely enrich our understanding of monogamy.

If, however, one wishes to grasp only a brief reflective summary to justify the choice of an exclusive union between a single woman and a single man, it will be sufficient to read the last chapter and the conclusion of this Note , which focus on the mutual belonging of spouses and on conjugal charity. In any case, we suggest patiently reading the Note in its entirety to fully grasp the breadth of the aspects involved in this rich subject.

I. Introduction

1. [ Una caro ] “One flesh” is the way the Bible expresses marital unity. In everyday language, however, “the two of us” is an expression that appears when there is a strong sense of reciprocity in a marriage, that is, the perception of the beauty of an exclusive love, of an alliance between two people who share life in its entirety, with all its struggles and hopes. “The two of us” is used when referring to shared desires, sufferings, ideas, and dreams: in a word, when referring to stories that only spouses have experienced. This is a verbal manifestation of something deeper: a conviction and a decision to belong to each other, to be “one flesh,” to walk the path of life together. As Pope Francis said : “Spouses too should form a first person plural, an “we.” Standing before each other as an "I" and a "you", and standing before the rest of the world, including the children, as an "us"» [1] . This happens because, although they are two different people, two individualities who each retain their own and non-transferable identity, they have forged with their free consent a union that places them together before the world. It is a union that opens generously to others, but always starting from that unique and exclusive reality of the conjugal "us".

2. Saint John Paul II , speaking of monogamy, maintained that it «deserves to be studied ever more deeply» [2] . His indication of the need for a broader treatment of this theme is one of the motivations that prompted the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith to prepare this Doctrinal Note . Furthermore, at the origin of this text are, on the one hand, the various dialogues with the Bishops of Africa and other continents on the question of polygamy, in the context of their ad limina visits [3] , and, on the other, the observation that various public forms of non-monogamous unions – sometimes called “polyamory” – are growing in the West, in addition to the more private or secret ones that have been common throughout history.

3. But these reasons are subordinate to the first, because, properly understood, monogamy is not simply the opposite of polygamy. It is much more, and a deeper understanding of it allows us to conceive of marriage in all its richness and fruitfulness. The issue is intimately linked to the unitive purpose of sexuality, which is not limited to ensuring procreation, but helps enrich and strengthen the unique and exclusive union and the sense of mutual belonging.

4. As the Code of Canon Law itself states : "the essential properties of marriage are unity and indissolubility" [4] . Elsewhere, the same Code states that marriage is "a bond which by its nature is perpetual and exclusive " [5] . It is worth noting that there is an abundant bibliography on the indissolubility of the conjugal union in Catholic literature: this theme has had much more space in the Magisterium, in particular in the recent teaching of many Bishops in the face of the legalization of divorce in various countries. On the unity of marriage - marriage understood, that is, as a unique and exclusive union between one man and one woman - one finds, on the contrary, a less extensive development of reflection than on the theme of indissolubility both in the Magisterium and in manuals dedicated to the subject.

5. For this reason, in this text we have chosen to focus on the property of unity and its existential reflection: the intimate and all-encompassing communion between spouses . Therefore, in order not to expect from this Note something it does not intend to develop, it is necessary to insist that, in the pages that follow, it will not deal with marital indissolubility—a union that lasts until death separates Christian spouses—nor with the purpose of procreation: both themes are abundantly treated in theology and the Magisterium. The Note will focus only on the first essential property of marriage, unity, which can be defined as the unique and exclusive union between a single woman and a single man, or, in other words, as the mutual belonging of the two, which cannot be shared with others.

6. This property is so essential and primary that marriage is often defined simply as “union”. Thus, the Summa Theologiae of St. Thomas Aquinas states that «marriage is the marital union ( coniunctio ) of man with woman, contracted by legitimate persons, which implies an inseparable communion of life» [6] , and that «it is evident that in marriage there exists a union by which one is called husband and the other wife; and this union is marriage » [7] . A similar definition was already found in Justinian, who collected pre-existing opinions: «it is the union ( coniunctio ) of man and woman which contains an inseparable communion of life» [8] . Closer to us, Dietrich von Hildebrand maintains that marriage «is the deepest and most intimate union between human persons» [9] .

7. Already in these classical definitions we see that the unity of the two spouses, as an objective foundational fact and essential property of every marriage, is called to constant expression and development as a "communion of life", that is, as conjugal friendship, mutual help, total sharing which, with the help of grace, increasingly represents another union that transcends and encompasses it: the union between Christ and his beloved bride, the Church, the People of God for whom he gave his blood (cf. Eph 5:25-32).

8. Saint John Paul II intimately connects these two aspects. Indeed, if «by virtue of the covenant of conjugal love, man and woman 'are no longer two, but one flesh' ( Mt 19:6; cf. Gen 2:24)», at the same time «they are called to grow continually in their communion […] so that every day they progress towards an ever richer union between them at all levels» [10] .

9. In this Note , therefore, we will examine both unity as an essential property, an objective and constitutive reality of marriage, the first and founding characteristic of all its manifestations, and the different expressions of that same unity which enrich and strengthen the conjugal alliance, thus making it possible at the same time to perceive this unity not as a monolithic reflection of divine unity, but as an expression of the one God who is communion in Trinitarian relations.

10. Finally, it is hoped that this Note on the value of monogamy, intended primarily for Bishops, referring to such an important and at the same time very beautiful theme, may be of help to already married couples, engaged couples and young people thinking of a future union in order to grasp even better the richness of the Christian proposal on marriage. It is true that, for many, such a message may sound strange or against the current, but we can apply to it the following words of Saint Augustine: "Give me a heart that loves, and it will understand what I say" [11] . Moreover, a true passion for the beauty of conjugal love has found expression in the dedication of many believers, men and women, clergy and laity, individually or in ecclesial groups, who have accompanied many couples on their life journey and have also developed a spirituality and a pastoral approach to marriage. For all these shining examples we can only express our dutiful thanks.

 

II. Monogamy in the Bible

11. «They are no longer two, but one flesh» ( Mk 10:8). This declaration of Jesus regarding marriage expresses the beauty of love, a cement which «gives solidity to this community of life, and the impetus which draws it towards an ever more perfect fullness» [12] . Instituted "at the beginning" already at the moment of Creation, marriage appears as a conjugal pact willed by God, as «a sacrament of the Creator of the universe, therefore inscribed in the human being himself, who is oriented towards this path, in which the man abandons his parents and unites himself to his woman to form one flesh, so that the two may become a single existence» [13] . Even if «it is known that the history of the Old Testament is the scene of a systematic defection from monogamy» [14] , given for example the events of the Patriarchs where we read, according to the custom of the time, of characters with more than one wife (cf. 2 Sam 3,2-5; 11,2-27; 15,16; 1 Kings 11,3), at the same time many passages of the Old Testament celebrate monogamous love and exclusive union: «Though the king's wives be sixty, the concubines eighty, the girls innumerable! But my dove is one, my all» ( Song 6,8-9a). This is also attested by the examples of Isaac (cf. Gen 25:19-28), Joseph (cf. Gen 41:50), Ruth (cf. Rut 2-4), Ezekiel (cf. Ez 24:15-18) and Tobias (cf. Tob 8:5-8). On the other hand, if from a factual and normative point of view monogamy does not have solid foundations in the Old Testament, its theological foundations develop in depth, and this is the fruitful path that will be followed in the following reflections [15] .

Monogamy in Genesis chapter 2

12. At the root of the monogamous model, chapter 2 of the book of Genesis presents itself as a true anthropological manifesto placed at the incipit of the Scriptures. It describes the project that the Creator proposes as the ideal for the freedom of the human creature. The divine exclamation: "It is not good that the man should be alone: I will make him a helper ( 'ēzer ) suitable for him" ( Gen 2:18), clearly highlights the need in which man finds himself as soon as he emerges from the hands of God, namely, a state of solitude-isolation. Despite the presence of other living beings, man wants a helper suitable for him (cf. Gen 2:20), a living ally, unique and personal, whom he can look into the eyes, as suggested by the word k e neḡdô , usually translated as "similar" or "corresponding", to highlight the need for a dialogical encounter of glances and faces. In fact, «the original Hebrew expression refers us to a direct, almost “frontal” relationship – eyes to eyes – in a dialogue that is also tacit, because in love silences are often more eloquent than words. It is the encounter with a face, a “you” who reflects divine love and is “the first of all goods, a helper fit for him and a pillar of support” ( Sir  36:26), as a biblical sage says» [16] . Man therefore seeks an irreplaceable face before him, a “you”, with whom he can weave a true relationship of love made of giving and reciprocity.

13. In his commentary on this passage from Genesis, Benedict XVI states: «The first novelty of biblical faith consists […] in the image of God; the second, essentially connected to it, is found in the image of man. The biblical account of Creation speaks of the solitude of the first man, Adam, to whom God wishes to place a helper. Among all creatures, none can be for man the help he needs, although he has given names to all the wild beasts and all the birds, thus integrating them into the context of his life. Then, from one of the man's ribs, God creates the woman. Now Adam finds the help he needs: “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh” ( Gen  2:23). […] The biblical account does not speak of punishment; the idea, however, that man is in some way incomplete, constitutionally on the way to finding in the other the integral part for his entirety, the idea, that is, that he can become "complete" only in communion with the other sex, is certainly present» [17] .

14. The conclusion of the biblical story: "a man will leave his father and mother and be joined ( dāḇaq ) to his wife, and they will become one flesh " ( Gen  2:24), expresses well this need for an intimate union, such a physical and interior attachment that the Psalmist uses it to describe the mystical union with God: " My soul clings to you ( dāḇaq )" ( Ps 63:8; cf. 1 Cor 6 :16-17). As Pope Francis states , "the verb 'to cling' in the original Hebrew indicates a close harmony, a physical and interior adhesion, to the point that it is used to describe union with God: 'My soul clings to you' ( Ps  63:8), sings the person praying. Thus the marital union is evoked not only in its sexual and corporeal dimension, but also in its voluntary gift of love. The fruit of this union is to "become one flesh", both in the physical embrace and in the union of the two hearts and of life and, perhaps, in the child who will be born from the two, who will carry within himself, uniting them both genetically and spiritually, the two "fleshes"» [18] . With the formula " una caro ", the reciprocal and total donation of the couple becomes an exclusive and integral relationship. Therefore, with the suggestive term of 'iššāh applied to the woman (cf. Gen 2:23), the sacred author wanted to remember that these two people constitute a couple, equal in their radical dignity, but different in their individual identity. The fullness of the union between human beings is in this equality made of necessary, dialogical and complementary reciprocity. Ultimately, according to the Creator's original plan, to which Jesus himself refers using the expression "in the beginning" in his commentary on the indissolubility of marriage (cf. Mt 19:4), a man and a woman are called in marriage to a unique, personal, full, and lasting relationship, to an exclusive covenant of life and love, which takes precedence over the social bond of blood (cf. Gen 2:24). From this perspective, the application of the nuptial metaphor to God's relationship with Israel, which emerges with all its force in the prophetic texts, opens an even richer horizon for understanding the life of spouses as a mutually belonging.

Prophetic wedding symbolism

15. In the Prophets, the categories of conjugal love give particular features to the understanding of the alliance between God and his people, no longer modulated according to the canon of pacts between the king and vassal princes.

16. Here, the personal story of the prophet Hosea (8th century BC) emerges in an emblematic way, which is taken as a theological paradigm for rereading the love story between the Lord and Israel (cf. Hos 2:4-25). Despite the betrayal suffered by his wife Gomer, he cannot extinguish his love for her and instead nurtures the hope that she, abandoned and disappointed by her lovers, will "return" on the way home in order to fully restore their love relationship, since that woman is the only one in his life, forgiving her for her betrayals (cf. Hos 2:16-17).

17. This symbolic nuptial transposition of divine fidelity will continue in the prophetic tradition, with different emphases: Ezekiel recounts how God cares for his people, like a man spreading his cloak over a woman (cf. Ezekiel 16:8). On the one hand, this gesture indicates the marital pact in which protection is offered to the wife; on the other, it aims to shield the woman from the gaze of others, thus evoking the exclusivity of the bond.

18. The prophet Malachi condemns the breaking of marital ties among members of Israel and remarriage to pagan women: "For I hate divorce, says the Lord, the God of Israel, and anyone who covers his garment with iniquity, says the Lord of hosts" ( Mal 2:16). This passage has also had another interpretation called "cultic" or "typological," as if it referred to a single perversion (idolatry), placing an implicit parallel between profaning the covenant with God and deceiving one's spouse (adultery).

19. Ultimately, conjugal love truly allows us to describe a dialectic of covenant between Israel and the Lord, between humanity and God. The idea of God as Israel's sole husband is also linked to that of Israel as its sole bride. The uniqueness of the beloved is also evident in the theme of election, which makes Israel the sole chosen people (cf. Amos 3:2). The covenant thus takes on a further dimension in that it designates the bond between God and his people, based on a monogamous bond so real that the worship of another god constitutes adultery.

20. San Giovanni Paolo II offre, al riguardo, una bella sintesi: «In molti testi la monogamia appare l’unica e giusta analogia del monoteismo inteso nelle categorie dell’Alleanza, cioè della fedeltà e dell’affidamento all’unico e vero Dio-Jahvè: Sposo di Israele. L’adulterio è l’antitesi di quella relazione sponsale, è l’antinomia del matrimonio (anche come istituzione) in quanto il matrimonio monogamico attua in sé l’alleanza interpersonale dell’uomo e della donna, realizza l’alleanza nata dall’amore e accolta dalle due rispettive parti appunto come matrimonio (e, come tale, rico
