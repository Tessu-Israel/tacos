the first Jewish readers: M. Barker, The Older Testament (London: SPCK, 1987), 221: “In the popular Judaism of Roman times, the menorah was universally employed as its symbol, and yet the Rabbis forbade its use. It was forbidden to make a menorah like the one in the temple; lamps with five, six, or eight branches were permitted, but a lamp with seven branches was not.”

The woman of the Apocalypse must: See Bernard J. Lefrois, S.V.D., The Woman Clothed with the Sun: Individual or Collective (Rome: Orbis Catholicus, 1954), 255–62.
This confirms what we know: See George Kirwin, “The Nature of the Queenship of Mary” (Ph.D. dissertation, Catholic University of America, 1973), 300. See also Edward Sri, “Treat Her Like a Queen: The Biblical Call to Honor Mary as Royal Mother,” in Leon Supprenant, ed., Catholic for a Reason II: Scripture and the Mystery of the Mother of God (Steubenville, Ohio: Emmaus Road, 2000), 81–97. For more on the institution of the queen mother in the Davidic kingdom and ancient Near Eastern dynasties, see Carol Smith, “Queenship in Israel: The Cases of Bathsheba, Jezebel and Athaliah,” in John Day, ed., King and Messiah in Israel and the Ancient Near East (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1998), 142–62; K.

Ben-Barak, “The Status and Right of the Gebira,” Journal of Biblical Literature 110 (1991): 23–34; George Montague, S.M., Our Father, Our Mother: Mary and the Faces of God (Steubenville, Ohio: Franciscan University Press, 1990), 89–101; N.

All have sinned, said Augustine: De Natura et Gratia 42.
“that the most Blessed Virgin Mary”: Ineffabilis Deus.
As early as the third century: Gambero, Mary and the Fathers, 69–70.
Saint Thomas Aquinas summed it up: Summa Theologica III, xxviii, a. 2, quoted in Donalds Attwater, A Dictionary of Mary (New York: P. J. Kenedy and Sons, 1956), 299.
This is a classic example: Saint Jerome’s refutation appears in most editions of the Church Fathers as “Against Helvidius.” Other commentators note that “come together,” in Greek, could apply to domestic arrangements (e.g., sharing a house) as well as sexual arrangements. Moreover, the Greek word for “until” does not imply what the English word until implies. Thus, a Greek historian could write: “Not a soldier perished until they reached safety.”
On the tacit reference to a previous vow of virginity implied in Mary’s response to Gabriel, see Geoffrey Graystone, S.M., “Virgin of All Virgins: The Interpretation of Luke 1:34” (S.S.D. dissertation, Pontifical Biblical Commission, Rome, 1968).
clear from scripture and Tradition: On the physical integrity of Mary’s virginal condition, prepartum and postpartum, see Catechism of the Catholic Church, nos. 499, 510. See also Saint John of Damascus, Orthodox Faith 4.15; Manuel Miguens, O.F.M., The Virgin Birth: An Evaluation of Scriptural Evidence, 2nd ed. (Boston: St. Paul Editions, 1981).
Saint Epiphanius dismissed: Gambero, Mary and the Fathers, 123. For an evangelical Protestant scholar’s defense of Saint Epiphanius’s view, namely, that Jesus was called “son of Mary” to distinguish him from Saint Joseph’s other children by his first (deceased) wife, see Richard Bauckham, “The Brothers and Sisters of Jesus: An Epiphanian Response to John P. Meier,” Catholic Biblical Quarterly 56 (1994): 686–700; idem, Jude and the Relatives of Jesus in the Early Church (Edinburgh: T. & T. Clark, 1990).
“This day the Eden”: Toal, Sunday Sermons, vol. IV, 427.
“So it was fitting”: Ibid., 434.
“What honors”: Ibid., 429.
the Church gives her honor: On the distinction between veneration of the Virgin and adoration of God, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, no. 971. The Second Vatican Council, in Lumen Gentium 66, clarified the unique veneration given to Mary (as distinct from other saints) and the unique worship offered to God: “Mary is rightly honored by a special cult [hyperdoulia] in the Church…. This cult,…for all its uniqueness, differs essentially from the cult of adoration, which is offered equally to the Incarnate Word, and to the Father, and to the Holy Spirit.” This outlook is reflected in Saint Epiphanius’s condemnation of the ancient Collyridian heresy, which held that the eucharistic sacrifice could be offered to Mary.
“God paid such honor”: Oration Concerning Simeon and Anna 5.
Pope Leo the Great: On the Nativity, Sermon 6.
“The Son of God became a son”: Athanasius, On the Incarnation of the Word of God 8. On the centrality of deification and divine filiation in Catholic soteriology, see A. N. Williams, The Ground of Union: Deification in Aquinas and Palamas (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999); Francis Fernandez-Carvajal and Peter Beteta, Children of God (Princeton, N.J.: Scepter Publishers, 1997); Paul Wadell, Friends of God: Virtues and Gifts in Aquinas (New York: Peter Lang, 1991); Romanus Cessario, The Godly Image: Christ and Salvation in Catholic Thought from Anselm to Aquinas (Petersham, Mass.: St. Bede’s Publications, 1990).

“maternal mediation”: See Pope John Paul II, Theotokos: Woman, Mother, Disciple (Boston: Pauline Books, 2000), 236–43.

In fact, the Marian teaching: See William G. Most, Vatican II—Marian Council (Athlone, Ireland: Alba House, 1972).
“by the power of the Holy Spirit”: On the close and profound correlation of divine maternity in the Holy Spirit, Mary (as icon or creaturely replica), and the Church, see John Milbank, The Word Made Strange: Theology, Language, Culture (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1997), 172–93; Paul Evdokimov, Woman and the Salvation of the World (Crestwood, N.Y.: St. Vladimir’s Seminary Press 1994), 189–225; F.
