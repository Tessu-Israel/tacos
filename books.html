            <h2>Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary</h2>
            <p>
               chapter 5
THE PERPETUAL VIRGIN
I will never forget the academic year 2003–4. It was my first year teaching as a full-time professor. After years of studying to earn my Ph.D., I was thrilled to finally get in the classroom and share what I’d learned. It also happened to be the year that the number one bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code was published. In it, the author Dan Brown claims that Jesus of Nazareth—contrary to what Christians have always believed—was married to Mary Magdalene, one of his female followers.
Lots of controversy swirled around the novel, but it was the claim that Jesus was not celibate that was at the storm center. For about a year, it felt like everyone was talking about it. The primary result for me was that I spent most of my first year as a professional academic answering questions about a pulp-fiction thriller! Over and over again—in the classroom, in the hallway, and even on airplanes—as soon as people realized I was a Bible professor they wanted to know only one thing: “What do you think about The Da Vinci Code?…Is it true?” Invariably, what they meant was “Do you really think Jesus was married?”
This is not the place to debunk the claims behind The Da Vinci Code. That’s been done before.1 For our purposes, the more intriguing question is Why were so many people so interested in Jesus’ virginity? Why does it matter whether this particular first-century Jewish man was celibate? Two answers come to mind.
For one thing, the claim that Jesus was married calls into question the historical truth of the biblical testimony. According to the New Testament, Jesus not only lived a life of celibacy himself but also called certain of his disciples to live lives of sexual abstinence “for the sake of the kingdom of heaven” (see Matthew 19:12).2 Moreover, the idea that Jesus was married somehow makes him more “this-worldly.” As Jesus himself says in the Gospel:
The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage; but those who are accounted worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. (Luke 20:34–35)
In other words, according to Jesus, in the final resurrection of the dead and the new creation, everyone will be celibate. Thus, disciples of Jesus who embrace a life of virginity now not only consecrate their bodies to God, they also begin to live out the future life of the resurrection in the present. Whereas married life and procreation belong to this world, in which, because of the reality of death, human beings must reproduce, the life of virginity points us to the world to come, in which death will be no more.
What does any of this have to do with Mary? Well, since ancient times, Christians have not just made bold claims about the virginity of Jesus. They have also made some striking claims about the virginity of Mary. Indeed, for almost two thousand years, Christians have claimed not only that Mary conceived Jesus while she was a virgin but that she remained a virgin her whole life long.
Why would ancient Christians make such a claim? Where did the idea of Mary’s perpetual virginity come from? After all, doesn’t the New Testament itself mention that Jesus had “brothers” and “sisters” (Mark 6:3)? Moreover, it’s one thing to believe that Jesus, who had no wife, lived a virginal life. It’s quite another thing to claim that Mary remained a virgin while she was married to Joseph.
In this chapter, we will explore the Jewish roots of Mary’s perpetual virginity. As we will see, at first glance it seems as if Mary lived an ordinary married life and had other children. Upon closer inspection, however, things are not quite so clear. In fact, if we interpret the Gospel testimony in its first-century Jewish context, there are multiple lines of evidence that from the very beginning of her marriage, Mary intended to remain a virgin and that she had no other children but Jesus. We’ll begin with the evidence for Mary’s Jewish vow of virginity.
MARY’S JEWISH VOW
There are three frequently overlooked pieces of evidence that suggest Mary intended to remain a virgin throughout her life: (1) the vow of virginity implicit in her response to the angel Gabriel—“How shall this be, since I do not know man?” (Luke 1:34); (2) the biblical laws for vows of abstinence for married women (Numbers 30:13–16); and (3) the evidence for the unusual abstinence of Joseph and Mary on their wedding night and during her pregnancy (Matthew 1:25). In this section, we will take a few moments to look at each of these.
Mary’s Response to Gabriel: An Implicit Vow of Virginity
The first important evidence that Mary intends to remain a virgin while married comes from Luke’s account of the annunciation and Mary’s puzzling response to the angel Gabriel. Although we’ve looked at this passage before, it will be helpful to reread it with the question of Mary’s perpetual virginity in mind:
In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you!” But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.” And Mary said to the angel, “How shall this be, since I do not know man?” (Luke 1:26–34)3
For our investigation, several features of the annunciation need to be underscored.4
First, it is crucial to realize that Mary is already “betrothed” to Joseph when the angel Gabriel appears to her (Luke 1:27). According to the Jewish Scriptures, a betrothed woman was legally married. For this reason, relations between her and another man were considered adultery (Deuteronomy 22:25–27). During the period of betrothal, she and her husband would live apart for a time. At the end of the betrothal period, which sometimes lasted up to a year, the husband would bring his wife into his home during a weeklong wedding celebration and they would consummate the marriage.5 Although it is very popular nowadays for preachers to say that Mary was an “unwed mother” when she conceived Jesus, this is just not true. At the time of the annunciation, Mary is a married woman who has not yet consummated her marriage with her husband.6
Moreover, notice that the angel Gabriel does not say that Mary has already conceived a child or that it will happen immediately. All he says is that she “will conceive” and “bear a son” at some point in the future (Luke 1:31). Once we realize that Mary is already legally married, the first part of her question to Gabriel—“How shall this be…?”—appears to make no sense. In the words of the atheist scholar Gerd Lüdemann:
Mary’s question is hard to reconcile with v. 27: a fiancée can hardly be surprised at the promise of a child even if she has as yet had no sexual intercourse with her fiancé.7
Along similar lines, the famous Protestant scholar Rudolf Bultmann once admitted that “Mary’s question” is “an absurd one for a bride.”8 Put yourself in Mary’s place and you’ll see why. If you were engaged to be married and an angel appeared to you and told you that you were going to have a child, would you ask, “How shall this be”? No. You would assume that you were going to conceive the child after the marriage was consummated. But this is precisely what Mary does not do.
So how do we make sense of Mary’s question? We pay attention to the second half of her response to Gabriel, which gives the reason for her question: “How shall this be, since I do not know man?” (Luke 1:34). Unfortunately, some English versions mistranslate this verse with the words “since I am a virgin” (NIV) or, even worse, “since I have no husband” (RSV). This translation is downright false, since Mary does have a husband! The original Greek, however, is quite clear: “since I do not know man (epei andra ou ginōskō)” (Luke 1:34; see, e.g., KJV, NRSV translation note). In the Jewish Bible, the expression “to know” is commonly used as a euphemism for marital relations, as when “Adam knew his wife Eve” (Genesis 4:1). Hence, Mary’s words mean “I do not have sexual relations with a man.”9 They have the same force as the English words “I do not smoke.” Just as someone who says “I do not smoke” means “I do not smoke (presently), nor do I have any intentions of smoking (in the future),” so Mary’s words mean “I do not have sexual relations (presently), nor do I intend to have relations (in the future).”10
Now, this is indeed an “absurd” thing for a betrothed Jewish woman to say, especially when we recall that she was already legally married. What are we to make of Mary’s response to Gabriel? In context, the best explanation is that she has taken some kind of vow of virginity and that she intends to remain a virgin. Consider the words of the Greek expert J. Gresham Machen (a Protestant):
This solution [of a vow of virginity] certainly removes in the fullest possible way the difficulty…No objection to it can be raised from a linguistic point of view; there seems to be no reason why the present indicative, “I know,” could not be taken as designating a fixed principle of Mary’s life that would apply to the future as well as to the present.11
Once her intention to remain a virgin becomes clear, Mary’s response to Gabriel is no longer “absurd.” Instead, it makes perfect sense. In contrast to Zechariah, who doubts Gabriel’s promise of Elizabeth’s miraculous conception, Mary does not doubt. She simply asks the question of how she is going to conceive since she is a virgin and intends to remain a virgin. That is why it is only after Mary declares that she does not “know man” (Luke 1:34) that Gabriel responds to her question by explaining that the conception of the child will be virginal. She will conceive through the power of “the Holy Spirit” (Luke 1:35).
Of course, this explanation of Mary’s response to Gabriel might make sense of Luke’s text. But it faces one obvious objection: Why would a young woman who intended to remain a virgin even enter into a marriage? Is there any evidence for ancient Jewish women practicing sexual abstinence within the bonds of matrimony?
Unfortunately, most scholars simply assume that a vow of sexual abstinence within marriage is impossible. Indeed, they frequently claim that there is no historical evidence for the practice of sexual abstinence within marriage in ancient Judaism.12 As a result, many modern interpreters are forced to conclude either that Mary’s response is simply “absurd” or that her words are merely a “literary device” used to prompt Gabriel to say something about the virginal conception.13
The problem with these approaches is that they totally fail to explain the text as we have it. They also fail to take into account the fact that we do have evidence for vows of sexual abstinence being taken by ancient Jewish women—including married Jewish women. Amazingly, the evidence for vows of abstinence is not hidden in some obscure Dead Sea Scroll or extrabiblical Jewish writing. Instead, it comes straight from one of the first five books of the Bible: the book of Numbers.
The Book of Numbers: Vows of Abstinence for Married Women
Significantly, the Jewish Bible contains an entire chapter dedicated to vows of abstinence made by ancient Israelite women (Numbers 30). Unfortunately, this chapter is universally ignored by scholars who dismiss the possibility that Mary could have taken a vow of sexual abstinence. Nevertheless, it provides us with biblical evidence for vows of abstinence being taken by unmarried women, married women, and widowed or divorced women. For the sake of space, we will focus on the verses that deal with vows taken by married women:
If she is married to a husband, while under her vows or any thoughtless utterance of her lips by which she has bound herself, and her husband hears of it, and says nothing to her on the day that he hears; then her vows shall stand, and her pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand. But if, on the day that her husband comes to hear of it, he expresses disapproval, then he shall make void her vow which was on her, and the thoughtless utterance of her lips, by which she bound herself; and the LORD will forgive her…Any vow and any binding oath to afflict herself, her husband may establish, or her husband may make void. But if her husband says nothing to her from day to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her pledges, that are upon her; he has established them, because he said nothing to her on the day that he heard of them. But if he makes them null and void after he has heard of them, then he shall bear her iniquity. These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, as between a man and his wife. (Numbers 30:6–8, 13–16)
Several features of this biblical statute stand out as important.
First, notice that the law revolves around a woman’s vow to “afflict herself” or as the NRSV translates it, to “deny herself” (Hebrew ‘annoth naphesh) (Numbers 30:13). Although this Hebrew expression is often used to refer to fasting, it also includes abstinence from sexual relations.14 For example, the book of Leviticus uses the same expression to describe fasting and abstinence from marital relations on the Day of Atonement. On that day, Moses says to the people, “You shall deny yourselves” (Leviticus 16:29 NRSV). Indeed, as the contemporary Jewish scholar Jacob Milgrom points out, the most ancient interpretations of this verse that we possess understand the idea of self-denial or self-affliction to include abstinence from “marital intercourse” (Mishnah, Yoma 8:1).15
Second, once the meaning of a woman “denying herself” is linked to sexual abstinence (Numbers 30:13), the whole chapter on women’s vows makes sense. In essence, it envisions vows of abstinence taken by three categories of women: (1) unmarried women (Numbers 30:3–5); (2) married women (Numbers 30:6–8, 13–15); and (3) widowed or divorced women (Numbers 30:9–12). In all three cases, the binding nature of the woman’s vow is dependent on whether her father or her husband, upon hearing of the vow, says nothing against it and thereby consents to it.
Third—and this is significant—if the father or husband hears of the woman’s vow and accepts it, then the vow is perpetually binding. Although the teaching in Numbers 30 could conceivably be applied to temporary vows, the context suggests the primary meaning is permanent vows. After all, what meaning would a temporary vow of sexual abstinence have for an unmarried virgin in her father’s house? The text makes sense only if it refers to a permanent vow of abstinence, of which the girl’s father approves. Likewise, what meaning would a temporary vow of abstinence have for a widow? If she had taken a vow of temporary abstinence from relations with her husband, she would (obviously) be automatically released from the vow by his death! (Think here of the prophetess Anna, whose husband died only “seven years” after their marriage but who chose to remain “a widow” praying and fasting in the Temple until she was eighty-four [Luke 2:36–37].) If a permanent vow of sexual abstinence is in view in both of these cases, then it makes sense to suggest a permanent vow of sexual abstinence for a married woman is also in view.
This at least would explain why the law specifically mentions a husband’s right to “make void” his wife’s vow to “deny herself” (Numbers 30:13). Now, it is possible that ancient Israelite husbands were so fed up with their wives’ constant fasting that a law had to be created to deal with it. But I find it much more likely that women’s vows of sexual abstinence led to laws being enacted to regulate the practice of abstinence from sexual relations. Indeed, it is very easy to imagine a situation in which the husband might later change his mind and decide to make his wife’s vow to deny herself “null and void” (Numbers 30:15).
Finally, it is important to point out that later Jewish writings outside the Bible confirm the biblical evidence for various kinds of women taking vows of sexual abstinence.16 For example, the first-century Jewish historian Josephus tells us that some married Jewish men and women who belonged to the sect of the Essenes would voluntarily abstain from relations for up to “three years” at a time (Josephus, War 2.160–61). Likewise, the first-century Jewish writer Philo of Alexandria describes another Jewish sect, known as the Therapeutae, which consisted of both celibate Jewish men and “aged virgins (Greek parthenoi), who have kept their chastity not under compulsion, like some of the Greek priestesses, but of their own free will” (Philo, On the Contemplative Life, 68). Last, but not least, it is worth noting that the ancient collection of Jewish traditions known as the Mishnah (usually dated around 200 A.D.) contains explicit references to married Jewish men and women taking “vows” to abstain from ordinary marital relations. If such vows became too extreme, they could be grounds for divorce (see Mishnah, Ketuboth 7:3–7; Nedarim 11:1–12).17
What is the upshot of this ancient Jewish evidence? Simple: If a young Jewish woman—say, Mary—takes a vow to “deny herself” (Numbers 30:13), and her legal husband—in our case, Joseph—hears of the vow and says nothing, then the vow stands, and she is bound by the Torah to keep it. In other words, it is the Bible itself that provides a solid historical basis for Joseph and Mary practicing sexual abstinence within marriage. Indeed, the book of Numbers is very explicit that if the husband changes his mind “and makes them [the vows] null and void after he has heard of them,” then the sin will be upon him: “he shall bear her iniquity” (Numbers 30:15). But as Matthew’s Gospel tells us: Joseph was a “righteous man” (Matthew 1:19); he was obedient to the Law. If Mary took a vow of sexual abstinence—and her words “How can this be, since I do not know man?” (Luke 1:34) constitute evidence that she did—and if Joseph accepted this vow at the time of their betrothal, then he would have been bound by Mosaic Law to honor her vow of sexual abstinence under the penalty of sin.
The Evidence for Joseph’s Abstinence
In case there is any doubt about all this, we need to turn to the third piece of evidence for Mary having taken a vow to refrain from ordinary marital relations. I’m speaking of the Gospel of Matthew’s account of Joseph’s abstinence:
Behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit; she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins”…When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took his wife, but knew her not until she had borne a son; and he called his name Jesus. (Matthew 1:20–21, 24–25)
To be sure, this passage is one of the most frequently cited proofs against the perpetual virginity of Mary. However, if we interpret it in its first-century Jewish context, it actually provides important corroboration for the evidence in Luke’s Gospel that Joseph and Mary do not engage in ordinary marital relations.
To begin with, although at first glance the statement that Joseph did not “know” Mary “until (Greek heōs) she bore a son” (Matthew 1:25) may seem to imply that Joseph did have relations with Mary after the birth, this is actually not the case. The Greek word “until” (heōs) simply describes a certain period of time, and does not imply anything about what happens afterward. Consider, for example, the following examples from Matthew’s Gospel, in which the word “until” (Greek heōs) clearly does not imply a change afterward:
“The Lord said to my Lord, ‘Sit at my right hand, until (Greek heōs) I put your enemies under your feet.’ ” (Matthew 22:44)
Jesus came and said to them…“Lo, I am with you always, until (Greek heōs) the end of the age.” (Matthew 28:20)
Perhaps the most striking example of all comes from the account in the Greek Old Testament of what happened to King David and his wife Michal after she despised him for dancing:
And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child until (Greek heōs) the day of her death. (2 Samuel 6:23 LXX)18
Obviously, the use of “until” here doesn’t imply that Michal began having children after she died! In light of such linguistic parallels, both Protestant and Catholic scholars agree that Matthew’s use of the word “until” (heōs) with reference to Joseph’s abstinence simply does not imply anything about what happened after Jesus was born.19 One Protestant expert on Matthew’s Gospel calls this fact “indisputable.”20 If this is true, then Matthew’s reason for emphasizing Joseph’s abstinence is not to deliver a preemptive strike against belief in the perpetual virginity of Mary. Instead, Matthew’s point is to show that there is no way Jesus was Joseph’s son, because Joseph did not have relations with Mary at any time during her pregnancy.21
In making this point about the virginal conception, however, Matthew reveals something extremely significant: Unlike an ordinary Jewish couple, Joseph and Mary did not consummate their marriage on their wedding night. Although it is easy to fly right by this point, it demands some scrutiny. From a historical perspective, how does one explain the abstinence of Joseph and Mary on their wedding night? In ancient Judaism, the climax of the wedding celebration was the consummation of the marriage on the wedding night in the “bridal chamber” (e.g., Matthew 9:15; 25:1–13). Yet Matthew clearly states that although Joseph “took” Mary to be his “wife,” they did not consummate their marriage on their wedding night (Matthew 1:24–25). And why don’t Joseph and Mary consummate their marriage either on their wedding night or during the pregnancy? After all, nothing in the virginal conception of Jesus would prohibit them from having ordinary marital relations.
The only plausible explanation for the abstinence of Joseph and Mary on their wedding night is that Mary had taken a “vow” of abstinence, in accordance with Numbers 30, and Joseph had accepted it. Indeed, taken together, the best explanation for these three pieces of evidence—Mary’s declaration to Gabriel that she “knows not man” (Luke 1:34), the biblical laws for “vows” of “self-denial” taken by married women (Numbers 30:6–8, 13–16), and Joseph’s willingness to abstain from ordinary relations with Mary (Matthew 1:24–25)—is that Mary of Nazareth had at some point taken a vow of abstinence, which Joseph her husband agreed to honor from the very beginning of their marriage.
Why would Joseph accept such an arrangement? We can only speculate. The Bible itself does not say. But if Joseph had even the slightest clue that Mary’s body had been “overshadowed” by the “power of the Most High” (Luke 1:35)—that she was in some way like a new Ark—then you can understand why he would consider her consecrated to God. If the old Ark of the Covenant was so holy that a Levite could not even touch it and live (2 Samuel 6:6), then how much more the new Ark? If the earthly Temple in Jerusalem was so holy that even the priests were required to refrain from sexual relations before entering it (Exodus 19:15; 1 Samuel 21:4), then how much more Mary’s body, the new dwelling place of God?22
In any case, at this point, I can easily imagine a reader objecting: But what about the brothers of Jesus? Don’t the Gospels explicitly say that Mary had other children?23 To that question we now turn.
THE BROTHERS OF JESUS
As is well known, the New Testament contains several references to the “brothers” and “sisters” of Jesus.24 At first glance, these passages seem to be the strongest argument against Mary’s perpetual virginity. They are certainly the most popular reason for thinking Mary had other children besides Jesus. Once again, however, we need to examine this evidence in its ancient Jewish context. When we do so, some of the very passages that mention Jesus’ “brothers” actually present important evidence that Mary did not have other children. Let’s take a few moments to examine the data.25
The “Brothers” of Jesus = Sons of a Different Mary
The first and most important reason for concluding that the “brothers” of Jesus are not children of Mary is also the most often overlooked. It is this: The Gospels themselves explicitly state that the so-called brothers of Jesus are in fact the children of another woman named Mary.
In order to see this clearly, all we need to do is compare the identities of the “brothers” of Jesus in the account of Jesus’ ministry in Nazareth with the accounts of the people present at his crucifixion and burial. For the sake of convenience, I will focus on the evidence in the Gospel of Mark, paying close attention to the names of Jesus’ “brothers”:
He went away from there and came to his own country…And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue; and many who heard him were astonished, saying, “…Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?” (Mark 6:1–3)
And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his last…There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome, who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him. (Mark 15:37, 40–41)
On the one hand, the Gospel of Mark indisputably identifies “James” and “Joses” as two of the “brothers” (Greek adelphoi) of Jesus (Mark 6:3). As any Greek dictionary will tell you, the most common meaning of the word “brother” is the same as in English: “a male from the same womb.”26
On the other hand—and this is crucial—the Gospel of Mark also provides solid evidence that the same two men, “James” and “Joses,” are the sons of a different woman named Mary. This other Mary is mentioned three times in the account of Jesus’ crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. At the crucifixion, she is called “Mary the mother of James the younger and Joses” (Mark 15:40). At Jesus’ burial, she is called “Mary the mother of Joses” (Mark 15:47). On the morning of the resurrection, she is called “Mary the mother of James” (Mark 16:1). Who is this woman? Obviously, Mark would never refer to the mother of Jesus as “the mother of James and Joses,” or “the mother of James,” or “the mother of Joses,” especially when he has already referred to Mary as Jesus’ “mother” twice in his Gospel (Mark 3:31, 32).27 Although scholars come up with some rather desperate attempts to avoid the obvious, the only plausible explanation is that the mother of James and Joses is a different Mary, and therefore, James and Joses are not the sons of the virgin Mary.28
In support of this conclusion, it is important to emphasize that the same thing is true of James and Joses in the Gospel of Matthew (although Matthew uses the proper Hebrew form “Joseph” rather than “Joses”). In fact, Matthew even refers to Mary the mother of James and Joseph as “the other Mary”!
There were also many women there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him; among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee…And Joseph [of Arimathea] took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed. Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the sepulcher. (Matthew 27:55–56, 59–61; cf. 13:55)
It is not believable that Matthew would refer to the mother of Jesus as “the other Mary.” Because of this, the Protestant scholars W. D. Davies and Dale Allison admit that this evidence suggests that “the brothers of Jesus” who are named earlier in the Gospel (Matthew 13:55) “were not the sons of Jesus’ mother but of another Mary.”29 I agree. But I would add that the brothers of Jesus also cannot be the sons of Joseph from a previous marriage, as some people suggest.30 The reason is simple. For Joseph to be a widower, his wife has to have died. But Mary the mother of James and Joseph is obviously still alive at the time of the resurrection!
In fact, when Luke refers to her simply as “Mary the mother of James” (Luke 24:10), a strong case can be made that he must be referring to the famous leader of the church in Jerusalem, also known as “James the Lord’s brother” (Galatians 1:19). The reason is simple. In the words of Richard Bauckham: “Normally in the early church only James the Lord’s brother could be called James without risk of ambiguity” (see Acts 12:17; 15:13; 21:18; 1 Corinthians 15:7; Jude 1).31
This leads us to the important question If James and Joseph are the children of another Mary, then why are they called Jesus’ “brothers”? The answer is quite simple: in an ancient Jewish context, the Greek for word “brothers” (adelphoi) could be used as a synonym for close relatives, such as cousins. Many examples of this usage could be given.32 For now, consider three:
But Jacob became angry, and quarreled with Laban [his uncle]; Jacob said to Laban, “…What have you found of all the vessels of your house? Set it here before my brothers and your brothers, that they may decide between us two.” (Genesis 31:36–37 LXX)33
The sons of Mahli [were] Eleazar and Kish. And Eleazar died, but he had no sons, only daughters. And the sons of Kish, their brothers, married them. (1 Chronicles 23:21–22 LXX)
On the same day the sons and brothers of king Izates…entreated Caesar to grant them a pledge of protection. For the present he kept them all in custody; the king’s sons and relatives he subsequently brought up in chains to Rome. (Josephus, War, 6.356–57)34
Notice here that it is the context that gives us the clue to when the word “brothers” means “relatives” or “cousins.” In context, Jacob is clearly using “brothers” (Greek adelphoi) to refer to his cousins, the sons of his uncle Laban (Genesis 31:37 LXX). Likewise, in the second passage, the “brothers” (Greek adelphoi) of the daughters of Eleazar are explicitly identified as first cousins, the sons of the girls’ uncle Kish. Last, but certainly not least, Josephus proves that a first-century Jew could use the words “brothers” (Greek adelphoi) and “relatives” (Greek syngeneis) as synonyms in the same Greek text.35
Likewise, when it comes to the “brothers” of Jesus in the Gospels, we have to determine the meaning of the word in context. If all we had were the reference to Jesus’ brothers during his ministry in Nazareth, it would be reasonable to assume they were his blood “brothers.” However, if later in the same Gospel two of these brothers, “James and Joses,” are explicitly identified as the children of another woman named Mary, then the obvious explanation is that the word “brothers” is being used to refer to Jesus’ “relatives.”36 If there is any doubt about this, it’s important to point out that Jesus himself actually uses the word for “cousins” or “relatives” to describe his so-called brothers and sisters. Reread the evidence from Mark, this time paying attention to Jesus’ final statement:
“Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him. And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own cousins (Greek syngeneusin), and in his own house.” (Mark 6:3–4)37
The word I have translated here as “cousin” (Greek syngeneus) is from the same Greek root as the angel Gabriel’s reference to Elizabeth as Mary’s “cousin” (Greek syngenis) (see Luke 1:36 KJV, Douay-Rheims). What possible reason can be given for Jesus referring to his “brothers” and “sisters” as his “relatives” or “cousins”? Maybe because, according to the Gospel of Mark, they are his cousins.38
Now we could just stop here. If all we had were the evidence from the Gospels of Matthew and Mark, it would be enough to conclude that the so-called brothers of Jesus are in fact his close relatives. They are the children of another woman named Mary from Galilee. But this is not the only evidence we possess.
The Other Mary = Mary the Wife of Clopas
When it comes to the identity of the brothers of Jesus, the Gospel of John also provides an important clue to the identity of “the other Mary” who was present at the crucifixion:
But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. (John 19:25–27)
This account of Jesus’ death provides us three more significant insights into the relationship between Jesus, Mary, and his “brothers.”
First, notice that John identifies the second woman at the cross as “his mother’s sister, Mary” (John 19:25).39 Although it’s easy to miss the point, this verse provides important support for the word “sister” (Greek adelphē) being used to refer to someone other than a blood sister. It seems extremely unlikely that Mary’s parents would have given both her and her sister the name Mary. However, the text makes perfect sense if John is using the word “sister” to refer to a close relative of Jesus’ mother.
Second, and even more important, when John refers to this woman as “Mary the wife of Clopas” (John 19:25), he gives us an important clue to the identity of “the other Mary” referred to by Matthew and Mark. If John is referring to the same Mary that Matthew and Mark say was present at the crucifixion and burial of Jesus—Mary the mother of James and Joses—then we have further evidence that James and Joses are not the sons of Jesus’ mother. Nor are they the sons of Joseph by a previous marriage.40 Instead, they would be the sons of another man—a man named Clopas.41
Third and finally, but by no means least important, in John’s account, Jesus gives his mother, Mary, to the Beloved Disciple to have as “his own” mother (John 19:26–27). I cannot stress the point enough: If Mary would have had any other children at the time of the crucifixion, it would have been unheard of for Jesus to give his mother to one of his disciples. In an ancient Jewish context, to fail to care for one’s aging parents was a grave sin—one that Jesus himself describes as a capital offense (see Mark 7:9–13).42 Thus, the most plausible explanation for why Jesus takes such pains in the midst of dying to make sure his mother is cared for by the Beloved Disciple is that Mary has no other children. He is her only son.
Once again, we could just stop here. If we only had the evidence of the New Testament we’ve just surveyed, it would be enough to confidently conclude that the so-called brothers of Jesus are in fact his close relatives, the children of Mary and Clopas, relatives of Jesus’ family. However, the New Testament is not the only relevant historical evidence we possess. We also have evidence for the identity of Jesus’ brothers from ancient church history—evidence that is often mysteriously ignored.
The “Brothers” of Jesus = The First Bishops of Jerusalem
According to the ancient Christian historian Hegesippus—who was apparently the first person to write a “history” of the Church—two of the so-called brothers of Jesus (James and Simon) also happened to be the first two bishops of Jerusalem.43 Furthermore, they were widely known to be Jesus’ “cousins”! Consider the following testimony from Hegesippus, which is quoted by Eusebius in his fourth-century history of the Church:
The same writer [Hegesippus] also [writes]…as follows: “After James the Just had suffered martyrdom for the same reason as the Lord, Simon, his cousin, the son of Clopas, was appointed bishop, whom they all proposed because he was another cousin (Greek anepsion) of the Lord. (Hegesippus [2nd century A.D.], quoted in Eusebius, Church History, 4.22)44
After the martyrdom of James and the conquest of Jerusalem which immediately followed, it is said that those of the apostles and disciples of the Lord that were still living came together from all directions with those that were related to the Lord according to the flesh (for the majority of them also were still alive) to take counsel as to who was worthy to succeed James. They all with one consent pronounced Simon, the son of Clopas, of whom the Gospel also makes mention; to be worthy of the episcopal throne of that parish. He was a cousin (Greek anepsion), as they say, of the Saviour. For Hegesippus records that Clopas was a brother of Joseph (Greek adelphon tou Iōsēph). (Hegesippus [2nd century A.D.], quoted in Eusebius, Church History 3.11.1–2)45
Amazingly, the testimony of Hegesippus that the so-called brothers of Jesus were in fact his “cousins” (Greek anepsioi) is frequently just ignored by scholars who assert that Mary had other children.46 But in the face of such historical evidence, this is unacceptable. James and Simon, two of the so-called brothers of Jesus, were not obscure figures in the early Church. In fact, they were the first two bishops of Jerusalem and some of the earliest martyrs. More important, they were known to be “cousins” of Jesus. Notice here that Hegesippus’ identification of James and Simon as Jesus’ cousins is stated simply as a matter of historical fact. There is no evidence that he is attempting to defend Mary’s perpetual virginity. To the contrary, Hegesippus is simply reporting the history of the bishops in Jerusalem. 47
Now, if Hegesippus is right, then the earliest historical evidence we possess jibes perfectly with the New Testament evidence we saw that the so-called brothers of Jesus—James, Joseph, Simon, and Jude—were in fact the children of another woman named Mary (Mark 6:1–3 15:37, 40–41; cf. Luke 24:10). It also makes perfect sense if this “other Mary” is the same woman who is called the “wife of Clopas” (John 19:25):
This, I would suggest, is the simplest and most historically plausible solution to the mystery of the “brothers” of Jesus. Again, the best explanation for the ancient Christian claim that the “brothers” of Jesus were his cousins is that the brothers of Jesus were actually his cousins.48
EVER-VIRGIN
At this point, I suspect some readers may be surprised by what we’ve discovered. Maybe some of you are wondering, “Why haven’t I ever heard all this before? Why didn’t I know that the Gospel of Luke itself shows that Mary intended to remain a virgin? Why didn’t I know that the Gospel of Mark itself shows that the so-called brothers of Jesus were children of another Mary?” I know that’s what I wondered when I first stumbled onto the evidence that I’ve just shared with you. Whatever the reason for our lack of familiarity with this data, one thing is certain: None of it is new.
If we go back to the writings of ancient Christians outside the New Testament, not only do we discover that they were well aware of Mary’s perpetual virginity, we also learn why they thought it mattered. In this final section, we will take just a few moments to show what ancient Christians had to say about the mystery of Mary’s perpetual virginity.
The Perpetual Virginity of Mary in Ancient Christianity
Nowadays, the perpetual virginity of Mary is widely rejected by Christians of many denominations, especially those who trace their origins back to the Protestant Reformation. Indeed, it has become so universally accepted that Mary had other children after Jesus that writers nowadays do not even feel they have to defend or explain the assumption that Mary had other children.
Yet it was not always so. Even a cursory study of ancient Christianity shows that from the earliest times, the belief that Mary remained a virgin was held by Christians throughout the known world.49 Consider, for example, the following quotations, noting the biblical bases for their beliefs:
If she had had other children, the Savior would not have ignored them and entrusted his Mother to someone else (John 19:26–27); nor would she have become someone else’s mother. (Athanasius, On Virginity [4th century A.D.])50
The expression “until” (Matthew 1:25) need not lead you to believe that Joseph knew her subsequently; rather, it is used to inform you that the Virgin was untouched by man until the birth of Jesus. (John Chrysostom, Homily on Matthew 5.2 [4th century A.D.])51
Already before he was conceived he wished to choose for himself, in order to be born, a virgin who was consecrated to God, as is indicated by the words with which Mary responded to the angel, who was announcing her imminent motherhood: “How shall this be done, because I know not man?” (Luke 1:34). And she certainly would not have responded in such a way if she had not already made a vow of virginity. (Augustine, On Holy Virginity 4.4 [early 5th century A.D.])52
Notice that this testimony to Mary’s perpetual virginity comes from Christians living in both the East and the West, writing in both Latin and Greek.53 Indeed, the belief in Mary’s perpetual virginity was so widespread that from early times it was regarded as a touchstone of authentic Christian teaching:
There is no child of Mary except Jesus, according to the opinion of those who think correctly about her. (Origen, Commentary on John, 1.4 [3rd century A.D.])54
Those who love Christ refuse to hear that the Mother of God ceased to be a virgin at a particular moment. (Basil of Caesarea, Homily on the Holy Nativity of Christ, 5 [4th century A.D.])55
Indeed, by the late fourth century A.D., when a Roman writer named Helvidius published a book claiming that the “brothers” and “sisters” of Jesus were the children of Mary, he brought down upon his head the wrath of the great biblical scholar Jerome. In his treatise The Perpetual Virginity of Mary, Jerome rooted his belief in Mary’s perpetual virginity in the Bible: “We believe that God was born of a Virgin, because we read it. That Mary was married [= had sexual relations] after she brought forth, we do not believe, because we do not read it” (Against Helvidius 21).56 Eventually, the belief in Mary’s perpetual virginity was so universal that when Christian leaders from throughout the world gathered at the second ecumenical Council of Constantinople, in A.D. 553, they gave Mary the official title “Ever-Virgin” (Greek Aeiparthenos).57
The Perpetual Virginity of Mary: Why Does It Matter?
Of course, that still leaves us with the question So what? Why does the perpetual virginity of Mary matter? I’ll offer you three closing thoughts.58
First and foremost, Mary’s virginity matters for the same reason that the virginity of Jesus matters: because the truth matters. Just as it isn’t right for fiction writers to claim that it is a “fact” that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, so it is irresponsible for scholars to ignore the evidence that Mary intended to remain, and in fact did remain, a virgin her entire life. As we have seen, Mary’s perpetual virginity makes the best sense of the most evidence in the New Testament. All the other theories have gaping holes. They completely fail to explain why the same Gospels that refer to James and Joseph as the “brothers” of Jesus also identify them as the children of another woman named Mary. They also fail to explain how two of these same so-called brothers, James and Simon, went on to become the first bishops of Jerusalem and were widely known as Jesus’ cousins, the sons of his uncle Clopas.
Second, the perpetual virginity of Mary matters because it points beyond her to the final resurrection of the dead and the coming of the new creation. As we saw at the beginning of the chapter, one of the reasons Jesus was celibate and called others to sexual abstinence was “for the sake of the kingdom of heaven” (Matthew 19:12), so that by their virginity, they might point to the life of “the age to come” (Luke 20:34–36)—the new world in which everyone will be celibate. Now if Mary is the new Eve of the new creation (as we saw in Chapter 2), then it makes sense that she would also choose to live out, in a unique way, the virginal life of the resurrection. Mary’s perpetual virginity thus points us to the eternal life of the world to come, the resurrection, and the new creation, in which ordinary marital relations will pass away because death will be no more.
Finally, the perpetual virginity of Mary matters because Mary, like Jesus, is no ordinary person. As we’ve seen in earlier chapters, according to the New Testament, Mary is the new Eve, the new Ark, the new queen mother. As a perpetual virgin, Mary is even more than this; she also becomes a symbol of the Church, who is both the virgin bride of Christ and the fruitful mother of all Christians. In the words of Ambrose of Milan:
Fittingly is [Mary] espoused, but Virgin because she prefigures the Church which is undefiled yet wed. A Virgin conceived us of the Spirit, a Virgin brings us forth without travail. (Ambrose, On Luke, 2.6–7 [4th century A.D.])59
Notice that last line: Mary gave birth “without travail.” What does Ambrose mean?
In order to answer this question, we will need to consider the next ancient Christian belief about Mary—one that is less well known these days, but even more mysterious than her perpetual virginity. I am speaking here of the belief that not only was the conception of Jesus miraculous but his birth was as well. To that topic we now turn.
