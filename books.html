            <h2>Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary</h2>
            <p>
               chapter 8
AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS
There is something inescapably sacred about a person’s last words. If you’ve ever had the experience of being with someone you love in his or her last moments, then you know what I’m talking about. Whether the dying person is your mother or father, your sister or brother, your wife or husband, your child or your best friend—if you get the chance to hear them speak, you do not forget the last things they say. Last words reveal the heart of a person: who and what mattered to them in this world, and what they thought most important to say before passing over into the silence of death.
The same thing is true of Jesus’ last words from the cross. They matter too, because they reveal his heart, who and what mattered to him, and what he thought most important to say in the last moments of his earthly life. In this final chapter, I want to bring our journey to a close by focusing on what Jesus said about Mary before he died on the cross. Although we’ve looked at John’s account of Jesus’ death more than once, consider it one last time:
But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. After this Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfil the scripture), “I thirst.” A bowl full of vinegar stood there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, “It is finished”; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. (John 19:25–30)
According to the Gospels, Jesus speaks seven times from the cross; but these are the only words that are directly addressed to a follower of his. What are we to make of them? Given the fact that crucifixion was basically death by asphyxiation, why would Jesus willingly suffer the excruciating pain it would have caused him to pull himself up by the nails in his hands and feet and utter these words to his mother and his disciple?1 What does Jesus mean when he says, “behold, your son,” and “behold, your mother”?
JESUS’ LAST WORDS
On the level of the historical meaning of the words, the answer is straightforward but significant.
First, Jesus’ words to Mary and the Beloved Disciple are a kind of formal last will and testament. As biblical scholars have pointed out, in the ancient world, a man sentenced to death by execution was legally able to bequeath his possessions by simply declaring his will from the cross.2 When it comes to Jesus, of course, he has no possessions: no money, no land, and no home to give away. He doesn’t even have any clothes, since the soldiers have already stripped him of his garments and divided them among themselves by casting lots (John 19:23–24). Thus, the only earthly “possession” Jesus has left is his mother. And he even gives her away. As a result, he dies in complete poverty.
Second, Jesus’ last words to Mary and John are a kind of formal act of adoption, by which Mary takes John to be her adopted son, and John takes Mary to be his adoptive mother. In the words of one Protestant scholar:
From the cross, Jesus sees his mother and the Beloved Disciple standing nearby and, with a simple statement, gives the Beloved Disciple as a son to his mother and gives his mother to the Beloved Disciple. By this ceremonial act, a new relationship is formed; a new family is created.3
In ancient Judaism, adoptive relationships were real; they were legally binding. (Think here of the genealogy of Joseph and his adoptive fatherhood toward Jesus.)4 In other words, Jesus is not just expressing a fleeting wish on his part for someone to “look after” Mary once he has died. He is making a formal declaration of his will: Mary really becomes John’s mother and John really becomes Mary’s son.
Third and finally, lest there be any doubt about this, it is important to emphasize the Beloved Disciple’s response: “From that hour the disciple took her to his own home” (John 19:27). On one level, this means that the Beloved Disciple took Mary to live with him—a point that is corroborated by the fact that after the resurrection, when the apostles are gathered together in Jerusalem awaiting Pentecost, “Mary the mother of Jesus” is there with them (Acts 1:14). On the other hand, the original Greek of John’s Gospel does not use the ordinary word for “home” (Greek oikos). What John actually says is that he took Mary “to his own” (Greek eis ta idia) (John 19:27). The Greek word idia is “a broader term that means one’s ‘own,’ ” as in one’s own family, people, or possessions (e.g., John 1:11; Luke 18:28–29).5 In other words, the Beloved Disciple is to treat Mary as his mother. By accepting Jesus’ last will and testament, the mother of Jesus is now John’s own mother and he is now her own son.
In sum, according to the New Testament, the fate of Mary his mother was one of the things that mattered most to Jesus during his last moments on the cross. Only once he has given Mary away to the Beloved Disciple can it be said that “all was now finished” (John 19:28). Only after he has given Mary to John does he lay down his life: “He bowed his head and gave up his spirit” (John 19:30).
HE TOOK HER TO BE HIS OWN
But this is not the only meaning of Jesus’ words. Since ancient times, the Gospel of John has been referred to as the “spiritual Gospel.”6 One reason is that in it there’s almost always a deeper spiritual meaning to Jesus’ words and actions. From this point of view, the last words of Jesus to Mary and John—“Behold, your son…Behold, your mother” (John 19:25, 27)—take on a deeper significance.
For one thing, in the Gospel of John, the Beloved Disciple is an “ideal figure.”7 He is not just a historical follower of Jesus; in a certain sense, he symbolizes what every true “disciple” should aspire to be.8 As Jesus himself says at the Last Supper: “By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love” (John 15:8–9). In other words, every true “disciple” is called to be a “beloved” disciple. Indeed, one plausible reason the author of John’s Gospel does not use the Beloved Disciple’s name is that he wants the reader to see himself or herself in the figure of the disciple “whom Jesus loved” (John 13:23).
If this is correct, then when Jesus speaks his last words to the Beloved Disciple from the cross, in a certain sense, he is also speaking to every disciple. Jesus is saying to each one of his followers: “Behold, your mother.” As one Protestant commentator on the Gospel of John writes:
Mary, the Mother of the Lord, becomes the mother of the faithful, and the Beloved Disciple here seems to denote the ideal Christian convert.9
Notice that this new relationship with Mary is not based on biology or blood; it is created through the passion and death of Jesus. It is the suffering of his “hour” that makes Mary our mother.10 We are the children of the “birth pangs” she experienced at the foot of the cross (cf. John 16:20–21; Revelation 12:1–6). As John says at the beginning of his Gospel: “To all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God; who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God” (John 1:12–13).
Finally, and most important of all, if every disciple is called to imitate the Beloved Disciple, then Jesus is inviting every Christian to take Mary to be his or her own mother. This, at least, is the most ancient interpretation of Jesus’ last words that we possess. In his famous commentary on the Gospel of John, Origen of Alexandria writes:
The firstfruits of the Gospels is that according to John, whose meaning no one can understand who has not leaned on Jesus’ breast nor received Mary from Jesus to be his mother also. (Origen, Commentary on John, 1.23 [3rd century A.D.])11
In other words, Jesus is inviting all of his disciples to enter into a personal relationship with Mary as their own spiritual mother. His dying wish is for Mary to become the mother of all Christians, not just of the Beloved Disciple.
BEHOLD, YOUR MOTHER
But what happens when you do this? What happens when you choose not to ignore or dismiss Mary but to really “behold” her? What happens when you take Jesus’ dying words to heart, imitate the Beloved Disciple, and take Mary to be your own mother?
I’ll tell you what happens: You begin to know Jesus himself better. You begin to see him more clearly. You begin to understand that everything the Bible teaches about Mary is really based on what it teaches about Christ. That, at least, is what Christians have believed since ancient times. And that is what I’ve tried to show over and over again in this book.
When you behold Mary as the new Eve, it does not take anything away from Jesus. Instead, it helps you to see more clearly that he is the new Adam, who comes to triumph over sin and death and usher in the new heavens and new earth.
When you behold Mary as the new Ark, it no more takes away from the glory of Christ than the Ark of the Covenant took away from the glory of God. Instead, you come to realize that Jesus is the new Bread of Life, who came down from heaven and was hidden inside the new Ark. He is also the new Moses, who has come to lead us on a journey that begins in this world and will end in the new promised land of the world to come.
When you behold Mary as the queen mother of the kingdom of God, it does not take away anything from the majesty of Jesus the King. To the contrary, you discover that her queenship and virginal motherhood reveal the deepest of all mysteries: that Jesus is truly Immanuel, “God with us.”
When you behold Mary as the mysterious mother of the Messiah, you begin to grasp the awesome and terrible truth that Jesus brings salvation through suffering and sorrow—not apart from it. And you also begin to realize that these sufferings, however painful, are nothing more than the “birth pangs” of the resurrection from the dead.
When you behold Mary as the new Rachel, mother of the new Joseph, who—against all odds—becomes the savior of the whole world, then you begin to realize that we are beloved younger brothers and sisters. You begin to see that he loves us so much that he even gave us his mother to be our mother—a mother who knows our sufferings and prays for us, just as Rachel did for her children on earth.
Finally, when you begin to behold Mary and take her to be your own mother, you will discover something amazing and precious. You will discover that she is already there, waiting for you. You will discover that Mary was beholding you long before you ever looked at her. You will discover that Mary was praying for you long before you ever began to talk with her. You will find that Mary was loving you long before you ever learned to love her. Because that’s how it is with mothers. When a mother gives birth, she sees her child long before the child can even open its eyes to see her. Perhaps that is one reason why Jesus speaks first to Mary: “ ‘Woman, behold, your son!’ ” (John 19:26). Mary too beholds the Beloved Disciple before he beholds her.
The same thing is true today. Mary, like Jesus himself, is not dead. She is very much alive in the heavenly kingdom. She already tastes the glory of the resurrection and the new creation. And she is beholding you; she is praying for you; she is loving you. Right now, she is waiting to see if you too will respond to Jesus’ last words and take her to be your own: “Behold, your mother.”

Appendix
JEWISH SOURCES OUTSIDE THE BIBLE
In order to situate the words and deeds of Jesus in their historical context, we need to be familiar with two important sources of information: (1) the Jewish Scriptures, commonly known as the Old Testament, and (2) ancient Jewish tradition, enshrined in a host of writings not contained in the Hebrew Bible and often not familiar to non-Jewish readers who are not already specialists in biblical studies.1
For this reason, it is helpful to briefly identify the various collections of Jewish writings outside the Bible that I refer to from time to time in this book. I cannot overemphasize that I am not suggesting that Jesus himself (or even the writers of the New Testament) would have read any of these works, some of which were compiled long after his earthly life. What I am suggesting is that many of these writings bear witness to ancient Jewish traditions outside the Bible that may have circulated at the time of Jesus. In particular, there are Jewish phrases, customs, practices, and beliefs reflected in both the New Testament and these extrabiblical Jewish writings.
In light of this situation, contemporary scholars such as Dale Allison, Craig Evans, Amy-Jill Levine, Craig Keener, John Meier, E. P. Sanders, Geza Vermes, and many others make abundant use of extrabiblical Jewish sources in their study of the New Testament. For a recent example, see especially The Jewish Annotated New Testament (2nd ed.; eds. Amy-Jill Levine and Marc Zvi Brettler; Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2017). In this volume, an international team of Jewish scholars utilizes both Jewish Scripture and extrabiblical writings, including rabbinic literature, to shed light on the meaning of the New Testament.
With this in mind, after the Bible itself, the most important Jewish sources utilized by contemporary scholars are the following:
The Dead Sea Scrolls: an ancient collection of Jewish manuscripts copied sometime between the second century B.C. and 70 A.D. This collection contains numerous writings from the Second Temple Period, during which Jesus lived.
The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha: a vast array of writings that are often attributed to ancient authors such as Enoch, Ezra, Baruch, and others. They span the centuries before and after the time of Jesus (from the second century B.C. through the fourth century A.D.). Many of these works, such as 1 Enoch, Jubilees, 4 Ezra, and 2 Baruch, give key insights into Judaism at the time of Jesus.
The Works of Josephus: the writings of a Jewish historian and Pharisee who lived in the first century A.D. His works are extremely important witnesses to Jewish history and culture at the time of Jesus and the early Church.
The Mishnah and Tosefta: two extensive collections of the oral traditions of Jewish rabbis who lived from about 50 B.C. to A.D. 200. Most of the traditions are focused on legal and liturgical matters. For rabbinic Judaism, after the Bible, the Mishnah remains the most authoritative witness to Jewish tradition.
The Targums: ancient Jewish translations and paraphrases of books of the Jewish Scriptures from Hebrew into Aramaic. The Targums emerged sometime after the Babylonian exile (587 B.C.), when many Jews began speaking Aramaic instead of Hebrew. Scholars disagree about their exact dates, which are very difficult to determine.
The Babylonian Talmud: a vast compilation—more than thirty massive volumes—of the traditions of Jewish rabbis who lived from around A.D. 220 to 500. The Talmud consists of both legal opinions and biblical interpretation, in the form of an extensive commentary on the Mishnah.
The Midrash Rabbah: These texts are ancient Jewish commentaries on various books of the Bible. Although parts of these are later than the Talmud, they contain many interpretations of Scripture attributed to rabbis who lived during the times of the Mishnah and the Talmud.
These are by no means all of the ancient Jewish writings scholars use to understand the New Testament, but they are the ones I have engaged from time to time in this book.

Acknowledgments
For years, I’ve wanted to write a book on the Jewish roots of Mary, but I never felt like I was ready. I kept putting it off, until my dear friend Sr. Julia Darrenkamp, F.S.P., finally twisted my arm—I mean, encouraged me—to just do it. So first thanks must go to Sr. Julia, without whom this book would not exist. Thank you especially for your prayers, and for being my sister.
Next in line is my amazing editor at Image Books, Gary Jansen. Words cannot express how much your friendship, support, and guidance over the course of this project have meant to me. Thanks for using your many talents to help me be a better writer. I also want to offer a heartfelt thank-you to all of my friends and colleagues who read and critiqued various drafts of the book: Michael Barber, Todd Russell, Jimmy Seghers, John Sehorn, Edward Sri, and Matt Ziifle. I’m grateful to Jennifer Ely for her positive feedback and for formatting the charts! I’m indebted to Mario Sacasa for patiently listening to me rattle on about Mary and for the breakthrough insight I needed to finish one particularly difficult chapter. I especially want to thank Kevin Redmann, whose truly amazing gift for languages ancient and modern caught countless mistakes I had made. Kevin, you have made this an incalculably better book. As always, I’m grateful to any and all of my friends—clergy, religious, and laity—who have prayed for me and supported me in various ways while I was writing this book, especially Carol and Herb Younger.
In closing, I want to thank my mother, who first introduced me to Jesus and to his mother. My image of Mary will always be shaped by you. Then, of course, there is my beautiful wife, Elizabeth, and our children: Morgen, Aidan, Hannah, Marybeth, and Lillia. Elizabeth, you alone know the sacrifices and suffering that went into the writing of this particular book. May they be for the greater glory of God. In a special way, this book is dedicated to Aidan, my son. May you always listen to the last words Mary speaks in the Gospel: “Do whatever he tells you” (John 2:5).

6. RSVCE, slightly adapted.
7. Unfortunately, the RSV leaves out this key Hebrew phrase. It is present in all other major English versions (KJV, NAB, NRSV, etc.).
8. Some readers assume that that the verb “greatly multiply” (Hebrew harbah arbeh) (Genesis 3:16 RSV) implies that Eve would have experienced labor pains before the Fall. However popular this view has become in recent years, it is likely incorrect. For one thing, the Hebrew expression puts the emphasis on the multiplicity and intensity of the pains, not on Eve’s state prior to the Fall. The Jewish Publication Society translation does a good job of capturing the sense of the text: “I will make most severe your pangs in childbearing” (Genesis 3:16 JPS). Moreover, in keeping with Genesis’ love for plays on words, the Hebrew word “multiply” (Hebrew rabah) is likely chosen because it echoes God’s first command to Adam and Eve: “Be fruitful and multiply (Hebrew rebu)” (Genesis 1:28). Whereas Adam and Eve were supposed to “multiply” their offspring, because of sin, God now “multiplies” Eve’s suffering. In choosing this word, the author of Genesis no more implies that Eve had birth pangs before the Fall than that Adam experienced fruitless toil or death before he sinned. Finally, ancient Jewish and Christian interpreters did not read Genesis 3:16 as implying pain in childbirth before the Fall. For example, Josephus explicitly states that God “punished” Eve by the “birth-pangs” (Greek ōdinōn) that come with “childbirth” (Greek toketois) (Josephus, Antiquities, 1.48–49). As we will see in Chapter 5, ancient Christian writers will also unanimously consider the pains of childbirth to be the result of the first sin. In the words of the contemporary Jewish commentator Nahum Sarna: “Intense pain in childbearing is unique to the human species and generally unknown to other female mammals. It therefore calls for explanation…[T]he rigors of childbearing are presented here [in Genesis 3:16] as a consequence of partaking of the tree of knowledge.” Nahum Sarna, Genesis (JPS Torah Commentary; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1989), 27–28 (emphasis added).
9. I have altered the Revised Standard Version’s “bruise” to “strike” (Hebrew suph), since “strike” is a better translation of the original Hebrew.

37. For the Catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception, see Catechism of the Catholic Church, nos. 490–92. I will not attempt here to trace out the historical development of the doctrine. I simply want to show its (often ignored) biblical roots in the New Testament portrait of Mary and Eve. For studies of its development, see Reynolds, Gateway to Heaven, 330–69; Sarah Jane Boss, “The Development of the Doctrine of Mary’s Immaculate Conception,” in Mary: The Complete Resource (ed.

50. Cf. Mary Cunningham, Gateway of Life, 182–84, who writes that Orthodox churches object to the Catholic doctrine of the immaculate conception because it results in Mary’s “separation from the rest of humanity,” makes her “physical nature in some way different from that of all other mortals,” and removes Mary’s “freedom of choice.” However, in Scripture, Adam and Eve are created without sin and yet are both fully human and truly free. In a similar way, according to Catholic teaching, the conception of Mary without sin in no way takes away from her freedom or her fully human nature. See Catechism of the Catholic Church, nos. 374–79. Compare McKnight, The Real Mary, 121, who rightly notes that for Catholics, “Mary’s sinlessness was not because she was divine. Mary’s sinlessness in official teaching is solely the product of God’s grace.”
51. On this point, see especially the words of John Henry Newman: “If Eve had this supernatural inward gift given her from the first moment of her personal existence, is it possible to deny that Mary too had this gift from the very first moment of her personal existence? I do not know how to resist this inference—well, this is simply and literally the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. I say that the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception is in its substance this, and nothing more or less than this…and it really does seem to me bound up in the doctrine of the Fathers, that Mary is the second Eve.” Quoted in Boyce, Mary, 225. For the original letter to Reverend Pusey, see John Henry Newman, Certain Difficulties Felt by Anglicans in Catholic Teaching (2 vols.; London: 1908, 1910), 2:44–50.
52. See McKnight, The Real Mary, 130–31, for the erroneous claim that “the doctrine of the immaculate conception” is meant to explain how Mary does not “pass on her sinful nature to Jesus.” It is significant that McKnight does not actually cite Catholic teaching (such as the Catechism of the Catholic Church) in support of this explanation, for no such teaching exists.
53. This line is cited in Catechism of the Catholic Church, no. 419. For the full context, see Pius IX, Apostolic Constitution Defining the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception, Ineffabilis Deus (Boston: Pauline Books, n.d. [originally issued December 8, 1854]), 21.

3. Propp, Exodus, 2:376: the Ark is the place of “theophany.”
4. According to the Old Testament, by the time King Solomon built the Temple, almost five centuries after the exodus, two of the three items were missing (see 1 Kings 8:9). No explanation is given for how the manna and the rod went missing.
