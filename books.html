THE NEW RACHEL
One of the great things about being a teacher is that you sometimes discover things in class, with your students, in the very act of lecturing through passages that you’ve read dozens of times. That’s what happened to me once with the biblical story of Joseph.
The account of Joseph and his “coat of many colors” had always been one of my favorite stories in the Old Testament (see Genesis 37–50). I love it because Joseph triumphs against all odds. Just when everything seems lost—betrayed by his own brothers, sold into slavery, falsely accused and falsely imprisoned with no hope of release—God not only saves Joseph but exalts him to the highest seat in the kingdom, second only to Pharaoh himself. Eventually, when his brothers realize who Joseph is and beg for his forgiveness, he gives us the key to the whole story: “As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive” (Genesis 37:20). In other words, precisely through his suffering, Joseph becomes the savior of Israel (his eleven brothers) and the Gentiles (the Egyptians).1
With that said, the way I understood the story of Joseph was unexpectedly transformed for me in class one day. While I was lecturing through the book of Genesis, one of the students raised her hand and asked: “Dr. Pitre, isn’t the life of Joseph kind of like the life of Jesus?” Not wanting to appear like I didn’t know this already (but not really having ever thought about it), I pulled the old professor’s trick of responding with a question of my own: “That’s a good question. What do you think? How is Joseph like Jesus?” As soon as I said this, something remarkable happened: One after another, the students began pointing out all kinds of parallels between the life of Joseph in the Old Testament and the life of Jesus in the New Testament—parallels that I had never noticed before. Here is some of what I wrote on the board that day:
The Life of Joseph
The Life of Jesus
1. Joseph is the firstborn son of Rachel and the beloved son of Jacob. (Genesis 30:22–24, 37:3)
1. Jesus is the firstborn son of Mary and the beloved Son of God (Matthew 1:25, 3:17)
2. Joseph is sold to the Gentiles for twenty silver pieces by Judah, one of twelve brothers. (Genesis 37:25–36)
2. Jesus is sold to the Gentiles for thirty silver pieces by Judas, one of the twelve disciples. (Matthew 26:15, 30)
3. Joseph is with two condemned men (cupbearer and baker), one of whom is pardoned and given physical life. (Genesis 40:1–23)
3. Jesus is with two condemned men, one of whom is forgiven by Jesus and given everlasting life. (Luke 23:32, 39–43)
4. Joseph is “thirty years old” when he enters Pharaohʼs service. (Genesis 41:46)
4. Jesus is “thirty years old” when he begins his ministry. (Luke 3:23)
5. Joseph is exalted to the right hand of Pharaoh, rules over the kingdom of Egypt. (Genesis 41:40–44)
5. Jesus is exalted to the right hand of God, rules over the kingdom of heaven. (Acts 2:32–33)
6. Joseph saves Israel and the Gentiles from death and feeds them life-giving wheat. (Genesis 41:55–57)
6. Jesus saves Israel and the Gentiles from spiritual death and feeds them eternal life-giving bread. (John 6)
7. Joseph gives special honor to Benjamin, youngest of the twelve, at a banquet. (Genesis 43:33–34)
7. Jesus gives special honor to the Beloved Disciple, at the Last Supper. (John 13:23)
8. Joseph is revealed to his brothers, who do not recognize him at first, after he is exalted to the throne of Egypt. (Genesis 42:8)
8. Jesus is revealed to his disciples, who do not recognize him at first, after he is raised from the dead. (Luke 24)
The effect of these parallels on the class (and on me) was mesmerizing. It was like we had uncovered a great secret together. I went home that day stunned that, after all these years of studying the Old and New Testaments, it had never even occurred to me to consider that, in addition to being a new Adam, a new Moses, and a new David, Jesus might also be a new Joseph.
As soon as I got back to my office, I began to do some research, and sure enough, I quickly learned that ancient Christian writers had recognized the parallels between Joseph and Jesus. To take just one example: In the fourth century A.D., the Persian Christian writer Aphrahat the Sage wrote an entire explanation of how, in the Old Testament, “Joseph who was persecuted was a type of the persecuted Jesus” (Aphrahat, Demonstration 21.9).2 So much for our “discovery”! As I soon learned, both ancient Christian writers and modern-day scholars have shown that “Joseph is one of the most striking biblical types of Jesus.”3
What does any of this have to do with Mary? The answer lies with Rachel, the mother of Joseph. In this chapter, I will argue that the New Testament not only depicts Jesus as a new Joseph but also draws several fascinating connections between Mary and Rachel. Indeed, if we can begin to see Mary as the new Rachel, we will also begin to understand why it is that ancient Christians thought of Mary not only as the biological mother of Jesus but as the spiritual mother of the Church, and a powerful intercessor with God in heaven. As we will learn, to this very day, Rachel is honored by Jews and Muslims alike, and the site of Rachel’s tomb is visited by devout Jews who believe in the power of her prayers of intercession.4
In order to see all this clearly, we will have to go back one last time and familiarize ourselves with what ancient Jewish Scripture and tradition had to say about Rachel’s role in the history of her people.
RACHEL IN ANCIENT JUDAISM
As with all the patriarchs and matriarchs in the Old Testament, beliefs about Rachel at the time of Jesus would have been shaped by what the Jewish Bible had to say about her and by developments in later Jewish tradition. Hence, before we can look at the connections between Rachel and Mary in the New Testament, we need to be sure that we are familiar with what the Old Testament and other ancient Jewish writings have to tell us about Rachel.
Rachel in the Old Testament: Mother of Joseph and Benjamin
When we turn to the pages of the Jewish Bible, four aspects of the portrait of Rachel in the Old Testament stand out as important for understanding the portrait of Mary in the New Testament.5
The first thing to know about Rachel—whose Hebrew name means “female sheep” or “ewe”—is that she was the beloved wife of Jacob, the father of the twelve tribes of Israel (Genesis 29:28–30). The Bible emphasizes that Rachel was blessed with great physical beauty—she was “beautiful and lovely”—and that Jacob did truly love her (Genesis 29:17, 20).6 Nevertheless, Rachel’s life was filled with suffering. From the beginning of her marriage, she underwent many hardships. Not only did her father, Laban, trick Jacob into marrying her older sister, Leah, but once Rachel finally was married to Jacob, she discovered that she was barren (Genesis 30:1). As a result, she and Leah became locked in a struggle for favor in their husband’s eyes, and both of them ended up giving their maidservants to Jacob so that he might father more children through them (Genesis 30:1–13). That is how Jacob ended up with twelve sons. He fathered six of them through his wife Leah, two of them through Leah’s maid Zilpah, two of them through Rachel’s maid Bilhah, and then, finally, two of them through Rachel herself (see Genesis 29:31–30:24).
Second, Rachel was the biological mother of Joseph, the eleventh of Jacob’s sons but the firstborn son of the wife he loved. As the book of Genesis tells us:
Then God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her and opened her womb. She conceived and bore a son, and said, “God has taken away my reproach”; and she called his name Joseph, saying, “May the LORD add to me another son!” (Genesis 30:22–24)
Once you understand that Joseph was the firstborn son of Rachel, the entire story of the coat of many colors makes sense. The reason Jacob favored Joseph and gave him the special garment was that in Jacob’s eyes, Joseph was the firstborn son of Rachel, the wife he had always loved. And the reason the ten older brothers envied Joseph was that in their eyes, he was simply the eleventh son and had no right to any special role or inheritance:
As this chart makes clear, the entire story of Joseph in the Old Testament hinges on one fact: that he was the firstborn son of Rachel.
Third, Rachel dies while giving birth to Benjamin, the twelfth son of Jacob and the only full brother of Joseph. In one of the most poignant stories in the Bible, we read:
Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor. And when she was in her hard labor, the midwife said to her, “Fear not; for now you will have another son.” And as her soul was departing (for she died), she called his name Ben-oni; but his father called his name Benjamin. So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem), and Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel’s tomb, which is there to this day. (Genesis 35:16–20)
Notice the meaning of the Hebrew names given to the child. Although Rachel names the boy “Son of my sorrow” (Hebrew Ben-’oni), Jacob changes his name to something more positive: “Son of my right hand” (Hebrew Binyamin) (Genesis 35:18). Notice also that Rachel is not buried with the other mothers of Israel (Sarah, Rebekah) in the family tomb; instead, she is buried on the road near “Bethlehem” (Genesis 35:19). Intriguingly, the author of Genesis makes clear that the location of the tomb is known “to this day.”
Fourth and finally, Rachel is not just the mother of Joseph and Benjamin. She is also the mother of all Israel, who somehow suffers with them and weeps for them, even after her death. Consider the mysterious oracle in the book of Jeremiah that depicts Rachel as weeping for her “children” who have been killed and driven out of the promised land and into exile:
Thus says the LORD:
“A voice is heard in Ramah,
lamentation and bitter weeping.
Rachel is weeping for her children;
she refuses to be comforted for her children,
because they are not.” (Jeremiah 31:15)
What are we to make of this passage? How can Jeremiah say that Rachel is weeping for the exiles of Israel in the sixth century B.C. when she has been dead and buried for centuries? According to Old Testament scholars, the key to understanding this passage is to remember that Rachel’s tomb was located near the place where the exiles were taken captive by the Babylonians.7 In other words, Jeremiah depicts “the spirit” of Rachel as still living, witnessing the suffering of her descendants, and acting as “the classic mother who mourns and intercedes for her children.”8 Indeed, it is precisely her intercession that succeeds in moving the heart of God. For in the very next verse, God tells Rachel not to cry anymore because her “work” will be “rewarded,” and her children will come back to the promised land (Jeremiah 31:16–17).
Rachel in Jewish Tradition: The Most Powerful Intercessor
So much for the portrait of Rachel in Jewish Scripture. When we turn to later traditions about Rachel outside the Bible, three things stand out as potentially important for understanding Mary in the New Testament.9
First, Rachel was remembered as a woman of intense suffering. As Josephus tells us in his history of Israel, not only did Rachel die “in childbirth” but her son was called Benjamin “because of the suffering (Greek odynē) which he had caused his mother” (Josephus, Antiquities 1.344).10
Second, the geographical link between Rachel’s tomb and the city of Bethlehem continued to be preserved in Jewish writings down to the first century and beyond. For example, the ancient Jewish writer Demetrius the Chronographer (3rd century B.C.) tells us that Jacob came “to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem, and there he fathered Benjamin; and Rachel died after giving birth to Benjamin” (Demetrius, Chronography, 2.10).11 Along similar lines, one later rabbinic tradition actually says that the reason Jacob buried Rachel at that particular spot is that “Jacob foresaw that the exiles would pass on from thence, therefore he buried her so that she might pray mercy for them” (Genesis Rabbah 82:10).12 Down through the centuries, Jews, Christians, and Muslims have come to regard the traditional site of Rachel’s tomb near the city of Bethlehem as a holy place of prayer. (In the twentieth century, we even have records of Jews visiting Rachel’s tomb to light candles and ask for her prayers!)13
Third and finally, in the ancient rabbinic commentaries, Rachel is depicted not just as the “matriarch” of her people but as the most powerful intercessor on behalf of Israel. For example, in one tradition, both Abraham and Moses come to God weeping and pleading for Israel after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, but God does not answer their prayers (Lamentations Rabbah 24).14 It is only when the “matriarch Rachel” intercedes with God on behalf of the sinful people that he responds:
Forthwith the mercy of the Holy One, blessed be He, was stirred, and He said, “For your sake, Rachel, I will restore Israel to their place”. And so it is written, “Thus says the Lord: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are not” (Jer 31:15). This is followed by, “Thus says the Lord: Refrain your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears; for your work shall be rewarded…and there is hope for your future, says the Lord; and your children shall return to their own border.” (Jer 31:16) (Lamentations Rabbah 24)15
Notice here that the belief that Rachel’s intercession was supremely effective is directly based on the prophecy of Jeremiah that we looked at previously (Jeremiah 31:15–18). As the modern-day Jewish scholar Jacob Neusner points out, the logic of this rabbinic tradition is straightforward. In response to the depths of her motherly sorrow, Rachel’s intercession with God “succeeds when all other intervention fails,” because “she speaks not of sacrifice but of love.”16
In sum, although Rachel may not be the most well-known woman of the Old Testament in contemporary Christian circles, the same thing was not true in ancient Judaism. As the wife of Jacob/Israel himself, Rachel was regarded in a special way as the sorrowful mother of all Israel, whose special role was to pray for and intercede on behalf of her children, even though she was no longer here on earth.
MARY THE NEW RACHEL
With all of this Jewish background in mind, when we open the pages of the New Testament, we discover several fascinating but often overlooked links between the figure of Rachel and Mary, the mother of Jesus.
The Massacre of the Infants: Rachel, Mary, and Their Children
The first and most explicit connection between Rachel in the Old Testament and Mary in the New Testament comes in the famous story of King Herod’s massacre of the infant children in Bethlehem. Although the story is well known, read it again in light of everything we’ve learned so far about the figure of Rachel in ancient Judaism:
Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: “A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they were no more.” But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child’s life are dead.” And he rose and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel. (Matthew 2:16–21, quoting Jeremiah 31:15)
Notice three things about this mysterious and tragic event.
First and foremost, the massacre of the infants happens in the vicinity of Rachel’s tomb. Just as Rachel is buried on the road “to Bethlehem” (Genesis 35:19), so the children who are slaughtered by Herod are from “Bethlehem” and the surrounding “region” (Matthew 2:16).17
Second, although Rachel has died, she is somehow aware of the sufferings of her descendants, and she laments for them as the mother of Israel. That is why Matthew quotes Jeremiah’s prophecy of “Rachel weeping for her children” (Matthew 2:18; Jeremiah 31:15). In the words of one Protestant scholar: “Rachel, who wept from her grave in Bethlehem during the captivity [of the exile], was now weeping at another, nearer crisis significant in salvation history.”18 Intriguingly, Matthew seems to share the Jewish belief that Rachel, though long dead, is not oblivious to the sufferings of her descendants. She knows what is taking place on earth and grieves for them.
Third and finally, as the contemporary Jewish scholar David Flusser has pointed out, insofar as they both suffer for their children, Rachel and Mary are counterparts of each other: “In Matthew, Rachel is a symbolic figure for the suffering mother, in this case, the suffering Jewish mother. And Rachel’s pain for the dead children is also symbolic for the suffering of Mary in relation to her illustrious son.”19 Along similar lines, the Jewish scholar Jacob Neusner describes Rachel as “Mary’s ancient Israelite counterpart.”20 In other words, as the suffering mother of the persecuted child who is driven into exile, Mary in Matthew’s Gospel is truly a new Rachel. Indeed, on a very human level, it is easy to imagine Mary weeping not only for the persecution and exile of her own son but for the lives of all the boys who were massacred in the attempt to kill her child.
The Book of Revelation: The Woman with the Sun, Moon, and Stars
The second link between Rachel and Mary takes place in John’s vision of the woman clothed with the sun (Revelation 12:1–6). As should be clear by now, there are multiple layers of symbolism in this complex apocalyptic vision, which can be peeled away only by looking at the Old Testament passages to which John alludes, whether they be of Eve, or the Ark, or the queen mother.
At this point in our study, you might be tempted to think we’ve exhausted all of the biblical background to Revelation 12. Yet there remains one more passage that lies behind the vision. Reread it one last time, this time focusing on a different set of images drawn from the Old Testament:
And a great portent appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; she was with child and she cried out in her pangs of birth, in anguish for delivery. (Revelation 12:1–3)
Several aspects of this vision point us back to Rachel, the mother of all Israel.
For one thing, as scholars widely recognize, the vision of the woman in heaven is directly based on the dream of Joseph, in which the sun, moon, and stars symbolize Jacob, Rachel, and their eleven sons:21
Then [Joseph] dreamed another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, “Behold, I have dreamed another dream; and behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.” But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him, and said to him, “What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?” And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind. (Genesis 37:9–11)
Notice here that in Joseph’s dream, the “moon” very clearly stands for Rachel his “mother” (Genesis 37:9–10).22 When we remember that in the Jewish Bible, putting something or someone “under one’s feet” is often an image for royal dominion (e.g., Psalms 8:7; 110:1–4), the implication of John’s vision of a woman who is clothed with the sun, standing on the moon, and wearing a crown of twelve stars seems to be that the heavenly Mother of the Messiah is exalted above all Israel, including the patriarchs and matriarchs of old.
Moreover, as any first-century Jew would have known, the image of a woman “crying out in her pangs of birth (Greek ōdinousa) in anguish for delivery” (Revelation 12:2) could easily call to mind the one woman whose anguish in childbirth is explicitly described in the Jewish Bible: Rachel. As we just saw, both Jewish Scripture and later tradition remembered that Rachel suffered “hard labor” and that her “pain” (Greek odynē) was so severe that she died in childbirth (Genesis 37:15 LXX; Josephus, Antiquities 1.344). Indeed, in the ancient Greek Septuagint, Benjamin’s name is actually “Son of my pain” (Greek odynē) (Genesis 35:18 LXX).
Last—and this is significant—the woman clothed with the sun is not just the mother of the Messiah. She is also the mother of all the children of God. John is very explicit about this: “The dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and bear testimony to Jesus” (Revelation 12:17). Just as Rachel was regarded in a special way as the mother of all God’s persecuted children in the Old Testament (Jeremiah 31:15), so the heavenly woman clothed with the sun is mother to all those who believe in Jesus but are persecuted by the forces of evil.23
The Mother of Jesus and the “Beloved” Disciple
The third and final connection between Mary and Rachel may be the most subtle of all, but it is also potentially the most significant. Although I do not know of any New Testament scholar who has recognized the parallel, I would suggest that Mary is also being depicted as a new Rachel in the Gospel of John, insofar as she becomes the mother of the Beloved Disciple through her suffering at Golgotha.
Although we have also studied this passage before, consider one more time John’s account of the crucifixion of Jesus, this time focusing your attention on Mary’s becoming the mother of the Beloved Disciple:
So the soldiers did this. But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. (John 19:25–27)
In order to see the connections between Rachel and Mary at the foot of the cross, several points need to be kept in mind.
To begin with, as we saw in Chapter 6, Jesus himself compares his crucifixion to the sorrow of a woman in childbirth (John 16:21–22). For any ancient Jew familiar with the Scriptures, the image of a sorrowing mother giving birth would easily call to mind Rachel’s sorrowful delivery of her second son, Benjamin (Genesis 35:16–20).
In addition, just as Rachel gave birth to her second-born son, Benjamin, through suffering and dying in childbirth, so Mary spiritually “gives birth” to her second son—the Beloved Disciple—by her interior suffering and “dying” at the foot of the cross. It’s crucial to remember here that the prophet Simeon describes Mary’s future sufferings at the cross as having her “soul” pierced by “a sword”—in other words, as a kind of “spiritual death”:
Simeon…said to Mary his mother,
“Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel,
and for a sign that is spoken against;
and a sword will pierce through your own soul also,
that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.” (Luke 2:34–35)24
In other words, just as Rachel’s “soul” (Greek psychē) departed and she “died” giving birth to Benjamin (Genesis 35:18 LXX), so Mary’s “soul” (Greek psychē) is slain by the “sword” of the suffering she experiences at the foot of the cross (Luke 2:35).25 Mary’s suffering, like Rachel’s, is not futile but fruitful. For it is precisely through her interior dying that she becomes the mother of another child: the apostle John.
Perhaps most intriguing of all, if Mary is being depicted as a new Rachel and the apostle John as a kind of “new Benjamin,” then this would provide an explanation for the otherwise baffling question of why the author of John’s Gospel refers to himself as the “Beloved Disciple” (cf. John 13:23; 19:26; 21:7; 21:20). For decades, contemporary scholars have struggled to come up with a convincing explanation for why John refers to himself in this enigmatic (and seemingly prideful!) way.26 I suggest that the solution to the riddle lies in the Old Testament and in the fact that Jesus gives Mary to John to be his mother. Should there be any doubt about this, notice that in one of the most famous passages in the Jewish Bible—the last testament of Moses—Benjamin the son of Rachel is identified not just as the younger brother of Joseph but as “the beloved” of God:
Of Benjamin he said, “The beloved of the LORD,
he dwells in safety by him; he encompasses him all the day long,
and makes his dwelling between his shoulders.” (Deuteronomy 33:12)
Just as Benjamin is the “beloved (Greek ēgapēmenos) of the LORD” (Deuteronomy 33:12), so John is the “disciple whom Jesus loved (Greek ēgapa)” (John 19:26). By referring to himself as the “beloved disciple,” John indicates that he takes the same position amongst the twelve apostles that Benjamin once took among the twelve sons of Jacob: the “beloved” younger son of Rachel and brother of Joseph:
Old Testament
New Testament
1. Rachel
1. Mary
2. Joseph: firstborn son of Rachel
2. Jesus: firstborn son of Mary
3. Benjamin: “son” of Rachels “sorrow”
3. John: “son” of Marys “sorrow”
4. 12 Sons: Benjamin is “beloved”
4. 12 Apostles: John is “beloved”
In other words, just as Benjamin was specially loved by Joseph because they were both sons of Rachel, so John is specially “loved” by Jesus because they have the same mother. Just as Joseph was the firstborn son of Rachel in the Old Testament, so Jesus is the firstborn son of Mary in the New Testament. And just as Benjamin was the “son” of Rachel’s “sorrow,” because she had to die to give birth to him, so John becomes the “son” of Mary’s sorrow, because Mary becomes his mother only through the anguish and “sorrow” that she experiences at the foot of the cross.
MOTHER OF THE CHURCH
What is the significance of these connections between Mary and Rachel? If Mary really is being revealed as the new Rachel of the New Covenant, then at least three important implications follow.
Mother of All Disciples
If Rachel was indeed the “matriarch” of her people—the mother of all Israel (Jeremiah 31:15), then it seems clear that Mary, the new Rachel, is the “matriarch” of the entire Church. This is the only plausible explanation for why the book of Revelation describes all those who “bear testimony to Jesus” as “offspring” of the mother of the Messiah (Revelation 12:17, cf. 1–6). Just as Rachel was regarded as the mother of all Israel in the Old Covenant, so Mary becomes the mother of the Church in the New Covenant.
This spiritual motherhood of Mary with relationship to the Church as a whole is something that has been recognized since the early centuries of Christianity. Consider, for example, the words of Ambrose of Milan, when he speaks of the deeper meaning of Jesus’ act of giving Mary to John to be his mother:
“May the Christ from the height of the cross say also to each of you: ‘There is your mother.’ May he say also to the Church: ‘There is your son.’ ” (Ambrose, On Luke 7.5 [4th century A.D.])27
Clearly, since ancient times Christians have recognized that if Jesus gave Mary to the Beloved Disciple to be his mother, then this means that, in some way, he also gave Mary to all his disciples. Indeed, the idea of Mary’s spiritual maternity with reference to the Church is not something “made up” by Catholics in the Middle Ages; it is something that flows directly out of the will of Jesus as expressed to his mother and John while Jesus was hanging on the cross.
In much more recent times, Pope John Paul II expressed the same idea of Mary’s motherhood with relation to the Church, emphasizing that it is precisely through her sharing in the cross of Christ that she, in a sense, “gave birth” not only to John as her “second-born” son but also to the Church as a whole:
On Calvary, Mary united herself to the sacrifice of her Son and made her own maternal contribution to the work of salvation, which took the form of labour pains, the birth of the new humanity. In addressing the words “Woman, behold your son” to Mary, the Crucified One proclaims her motherhood not only in relation to the Apostle John but also to every disciple. The Evangelist himself, by saying that Jesus had to die “to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad” (Jn. 11:52), indicates the Church’s birth as the fruit of the redemptive sacrifice with which Mary is maternally associated. (Pope John Paul II, General Audience, September 17, 1997)28
In other words, Mary is not the mother of the Church because she happens to be the biological mother of Jesus. She is the mother of the Church because she willingly consented to and shared in the sufferings of Christ on the cross, through which the redemption of the world is accomplished.
Mother of Sorrows
If Mary is the new Rachel, then she may truly be described as the “mother of sorrows” (Latin Mater Dolorosa). Just as Rachel was seen as having a uniquely maternal role toward Israel because of the sorrows she suffered during her life and, even more, after her death (Jeremiah 31:15–17), so Mary can be seen as having a uniquely maternal role precisely because of the sorrows that she suffered as the mother of Jesus at the foot of the cross.
In this case, the words of the contemporary Jewish scholar David Flusser strike a powerful note:
Mary can be understood as a symbol for the church and also for her own people. But one should never forget that this woman once walked the earth—this mother of sorrows. The Mater Dolorosa is not a theological concept or an overpowering experience of the archetypal but primarily a real person who was inspired by her joy and never defeated by her unspeakable pain.29
Flusser has put his finger here on a very important point. In this book, we’ve seen lots of remarkable connections between the Old and New Testaments, and (I hope) shed some important light on key Christian doctrines and practices regarding the mother of Jesus. But at the end of the day, it’s important to remember that Mary is not a doctrine or a dogma, but a person. She was a real, living human being who, like all of us, had to walk the long journey through this valley of tears.
However exalted her status may be as the new Eve, the new Ark, the new queen mother, et cetera, Mary is still a human woman who knew what it was to suffer and have sorrow. That is what makes her such an amazingly appealing figure in the history of Christianity; when it comes to suffering, sorrow, and death, Mary knows what it is like to endure excruciating pain—the kind of interior pain that can be described only as having one’s “soul” pierced “by a sword” (Luke 2:35). Indeed, since Mary becomes our mother precisely through what she suffered at the foot the cross, we can truly say that we are the children of Mary’s sorrow.
A Maternal Intercessor in Heaven
Finally, if Mary is the new Rachel, then she, like Rachel before her, must be a powerful intercessor indeed.
Recall here that in ancient Jewish tradition Rachel was regarded as the most powerful intercessor with God on behalf of her children on earth. In the same way, if Mary is truly the mother of all disciples, then there is no reason to think she abandons her maternal relationship with the Church on earth just because her earthly life comes to an end. Indeed, as we saw in Chapter 3, if Mary was assumed bodily into the heavenly Temple to be with the risen Jesus forever, then she is most certainly not “dead.” Mary is a living intercessor; she is much more alive than any human on earth.
Perhaps this is why, as we saw in Chapter 3, we have ancient Christian prayers in which Mary is addressed not only as “Mother of God” (Greek Theotokos) but as the “refuge” of her suffering children on earth:
We take refuge in your mercy, Mother of God. Do not disregard our prayers in troubling times, but deliver us from danger, O only pure one, only blessed one. (Anonymous Christian Prayer [3rd–4th century A.D.])30
Notice that the ancient Christians who composed this prayer asked Mary to pray for them especially in the midst of “troubling times” and “danger”: both likely allusions to the bloody persecutions of Christians that were known in the early centuries of the Church in Egypt.
More recently, in 1964, the Second Vatican Council beautifully expressed this same idea. In its document on the Church, Vatican II taught that although Mary no longer lives in this world, she never stops interceding for her spiritual children on earth:
The motherhood of Mary in the order of grace continues uninterruptedly from the consent which she loyally gave at the Annunciation and which she sustained without wavering beneath the cross, until the eternal fulfillment of all the elect. Taken up into heaven she did not lay aside this saving office but by her manifold intercession continues to bring us the gifts of eternal salvation. By her maternal charity, she cares for the brethren of her Son, who still journey on earth surrounded by dangers and difficulties, until they are led into their blessed home. (Vatican II, Lumen Gentium, 62)31
It is striking to find this sentiment expressed at Vatican II also in the words of the contemporary Jewish scholar Jacob Neusner. In a truly remarkable essay, Neusner once noted that Mary’s role as a powerful intercessor on behalf of Christians made perfect sense to him given the parallels between Rachel in Judaism and Mary in Christianity:
That is why I can find in Mary a Christian, a Catholic Rachel, whose prayers count when the prayers of great men, fathers of the world, fall to the ground…No wonder that, when Rachel weeps, God listens. How hard, then, can it be for me to find in Mary that sympathetic, special friend that Catholics have known for 2,000 years! Not so hard at all. So, yes, if Rachel, then why not Mary?32
In other words, from a Jewish perspective, the idea that God would give a special place and power to the prayers of a loving and sorrowful mother is not only plausible but compelling. If God listens to the weeping of Rachel, the mother of his beloved children of Israel, then surely he will also listen to the weeping of Mary, the sorrowful mother of his only-begotten Son and the spiritual mother of all of the disciples of Jesus, especially those who are suffering and persecuted in this world.
At least, that is what Jesus himself seems to suggest when he says to John the disciple: “Behold, your mother.” Let’s bring this book to a close by turning our attention to these words—the last words of Jesus spoken to his disciples before he died.
