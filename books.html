            <h2>Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary</h2>
            <p>
               chapter 6
THE BIRTH OF THE MESSIAH
Out of all the memorable experiences I have had in my life, the birth of my first child is right there at the top of the list. What stands out most in my memory is how the birth itself was a mysterious combination of both pain and joy.
On the one hand, I was completely taken aback by the intensity of my wife’s suffering. To be sure, I had watched a video or two about what childbirth involved and had gone to all the requisite classes for husbands to learn how best to “help” their wives in the birth. Nevertheless, I was completely unprepared for the reality. Elizabeth’s labor wasn’t just extremely painful for her; it was extremely long, lasting some twenty-two hours. Moreover, when the time for what they called “hard labor” finally arrived, I had no idea there would be so much blood. I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that the delivery room began to spin more than once.
On the other hand, I was equally overwhelmed by the intensity of the joy I felt when, after all those hours, I finally saw my daughter for the first time. The sight of her jet-black hair and her tiny little face is still emblazoned in my mind. I don’t need a picture to remember it. Never before in my life had I witnessed someone I love go through such agony; never before had I simultaneously tasted such overwhelming happiness. The whole birth was one giant, terrifying, tear-filled paradox.
The same thing is true of Jesus. His whole life is one great paradox—a mixture of joy and suffering. From a certain angle, much of Jesus’ public ministry looks as if it is entirely devoted to taking away suffering. He heals the sick, he raises the dead, he makes the lame walk, he makes the blind see. Whether it is the woman who has bled for twelve years (Mark 5:25) or the man who has been paralyzed for thirty-eight (John 5:5), Jesus takes their pain away. Over and over again, he brings healing and joy.
Flip the coin to the other side, however, and you will see a different image: In the final analysis, Jesus’ mission is not to take away all suffering but to take it upon himself. As he says to the disciples: “The Son of man did not come to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many” (Mark 10:45). With these words, Jesus is alluding to the prophecy of the suffering Servant, who takes the pains and the sins of everyone else upon himself (see Isaiah 52:13–53:12). Likewise, in one of the last speeches he gives, Jesus warns his disciples that before “the end comes,” there will be a time of suffering such as the world has never known. He even uses the image of a woman in labor to describe it: “There will be earthquakes in various places, there will be famines; this is but the beginning of the birth-pangs” (Mark 13:8). In short, Jesus seems to come both to take away suffering and to unleash it. Seen in this light, the miracles of Jesus are not ends in themselves. Instead, they are “signs” that point forward to the ultimate overthrow of suffering and death that will take place through his passion, death, and resurrection, and his final coming in glory.
When we turn to the figure of Mary, we find a very similar paradox. On the one hand, her life is filled with the miraculous: the appearance of the angel Gabriel, the virginal conception, the star of Bethlehem and the coming of the Magi, the dreams of Joseph, the escape from King Herod (Matthew 1–2; Luke 1–2). On the other hand, from the moment of the annunciation, Mary’s life is equally full of suffering: the threat of divorce, the failure to find room in Bethlehem, the poverty of Joseph, Herod’s massacre of the infants, the flight to the foreign land of Egypt, the loss of Jesus for three days in Jerusalem, and above all this, the pain of watching her son—who was also “the Son of God”—die on the cross.
In this chapter, we will discover that this mysterious combination of the miraculous and the sorrowful actually goes back to ancient Jewish prophecies about the mother of the Messiah. In Jewish Scripture and tradition, the Messiah’s mother is paradoxically depicted both as being spared the pain of childbirth and as undergoing what came to be called the “birth pangs of the Messiah.” As I hope to show, both of these prophecies are true: One points to the miraculous birth of Jesus, and the other to the mystery of his death. According to the New Testament, Mary did suffer the “birth pangs” of the cross, through which came the new life of the resurrection. This will lead to the ancient Christian belief that Mary did not suffer labor pains at Bethlehem, but she did suffer them at Calvary. In so doing, she shared in the passion of Jesus in a uniquely fruitful way.
THE MOTHER OF THE MESSIAH
In order to see clearly the Jewish roots of the Christian belief in the miraculous birth of Jesus, we will have to go back to ancient Jewish Scripture and tradition, and see what they have to say about the mother of the Messiah. When we do so, we discover two fascinating (and apparently conflicting) expectations.
Isaiah’s Prophecy: The Painless Birth of the Messiah
On the one hand, the Old Testament seems to suggest that the mother of the Messiah will not suffer pain in childbirth. In a very important (but often ignored) prophecy, the book of Isaiah speaks of a woman who will give birth to a son without experiencing any pain:
Before she was in labor she gave birth;
before her pain came upon her she was delivered of a son.
Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things?
Shall a land be born in one day?
Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment?
For as soon as Zion was in labor
she brought forth her sons. (Isaiah 66:7–8)
Notice three things about this important passage:
First, the prophecy of the painless childbirth takes place immediately after Isaiah’s oracle about the coming of a new creation—“new heavens and a new earth” in which God will make a new Jerusalem (Isaiah 65:17–18). In this new creation, the effects of the sin of Adam and Eve will be undone: Men will no longer “labor in vain” and women will not “bear children for calamity” (Isaiah 65:23). In other words, two of the principal effects of the Fall—fruitless toil and pain in childbirth—will be undone (cf. Genesis 3:16–19). Second, the birth of the woman’s “son” is a miraculous and unprecedented “act of the new creation.”1 It is miraculous because his mother delivers her child “before her pain came upon her” (Isaiah 66:7); it is unprecedented because nothing like this has ever happened before: “Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things?” (Isaiah 66:8). Third, notice that the identity of the mother in the prophecy is ambiguous.2 At first, it appears to refer to an individual woman, who gives birth to an individual “son” (Isaiah 66:7). But then, it seems to describe the city of “Zion”—another name for Jerusalem—giving birth to multiple “children” as soon as she begins to “labor” (Isaiah 66:8).
What are we to make of this mysterious prophecy? Whatever contemporary commentators may say, for our purposes what matters is how it was interpreted in Jewish tradition. Strikingly, when we turn to ancient Jewish writings outside the Bible, the prophecy of Isaiah 66 is consistently linked with the painless birth of the Messiah. Consider the following examples:
Before distress comes to her she shall be delivered; and before shaking will come upon her, as pains upon a woman in travail, her king will be revealed. Who has heard of such a thing? Who has seen such things? (Targum Isaiah 66:7–8)3
The Holy One, blessed be He, was creating the light of the Messiah: thus…“Before she travailed, she brought forth” (Isa 66:7). Before the last who shall enslave [Israel] was born, the first redeemer was born. (Genesis Rabbah 85:1)4
In This World a woman bears children with pain, but of the Time to Come [see] what is written! “Before she will travail, she will have brought forth; before her pain will come, she will have been delivered of a man-child” (Isa 66:7). (Leviticus Rabbah 14:9)5
Notice that in the first two texts, the prophecy of Isaiah 66 is explicitly linked with the coming of “the Messiah,” the future “king” of Israel. This is extremely important, for it provides evidence that at least some ancient Jews interpreted Isaiah’s prophecy as a reference to the miraculous birth of the Messiah.6 Notice also the rationale for the painless birth of the Messiah: Since pain in childbirth is a result of the sin of Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:16–19), it belongs by definition to the old creation (“this world”). In the new creation (“the world to come”), women will not experience such pain. In other words, because the Messiah himself will usher in the new creation, it is fitting that his birth would be the beginning of this new creation, in which the effects of the sin of Adam and Eve would be undone.
Micah’s Prophecy: The Birth Pangs of the Messiah
With that said, the Old Testament also seems to suggest that the mother of the Messiah will suffer during her “labor.” I am speaking here of the prophet Micah’s famous oracle about the coming of the Messiah. Although we’ve looked at this passage before, let’s look again, this time keeping our eyes on the imagery of labor pains:
But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,
who are little to be among the clans of Judah,
from you shall come forth for me
one who is to be ruler in Israel,
whose origin is from of old, from ancient days.
Therefore he shall give them up until the time
when she who is in labor has brought forth;
then the rest of his brethren shall return
to the people of Israel. (Micah 5:2–3)7
Again, three aspects of this passage are worth highlighting.
First, the prophecy is clearly about the coming of the future Davidic king, the “ruler” who will come from “Bethlehem” (David’s town) as well as from “ancient days.” In other words, it is about the “appearance of a new Messianic king.”8 Second, the passage is also about “the human mother” of the future king.9 She is the woman who will be “in travail” until she has “brought forth” (Micah 5:3). The Hebrew expression for being “in travail” or, more literally, “in labor” (Hebrew yoledah) in this verse is used elsewhere to describe the sufferings involved in giving birth to a child (Micah 4:9–10; cf. Genesis 35:16–17; Jeremiah 30:6). Third and finally, the prophecy also seems to say that the people of Israel as a whole are going to experience a time of intense suffering before the king comes: God will “give them up” until the time when “she who is in travail has brought forth” (Micah 5:3). In the Hebrew Scriptures, the prophets frequently use the imagery of a woman’s “birth pangs” to symbolize the time of intense suffering that will precede the coming of the king and the resurrection of the dead (see Micah 4:9–10; Isaiah 26:16–19; Jeremiah 30:4–9). After this time of anguish, the people of Israel will “return” to the promised land, and the king himself will reign over a universal kingdom that will spread “to the ends of the earth” (Micah 5:4).10
What are we to make of Micah’s prophecy of the woman in labor? Again, when we turn to the most ancient Jewish interpretations we possess, we discover that Micah’s prophecy was linked both with the birth of the Messiah and with a mysterious period of tribulation known as the “birth pangs of the Messiah.”11 Consider the words of the ancient Jewish Targum and the Talmud:
And you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah…from you shall come forth before me the Messiah, to exercise dominion over Israel, he whose name was mentioned from of old, from ancient times. Then they shall be handed over in the time when she who is in labour gives birth…He shall arise and rule with might from the Lord. (Targum on Micah 5:1–3)12
Rab said: “The son of David will not come until the [Roman] power enfolds Israel for nine months, as it is written: ‘Therefore he will give them up, until the time that she who is in labor has brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel’ (Micah 5:2).” [Rabbi] Ulla said: “Let him [the Messiah] come, but let me not see him…” [Rabbi] Abaye inquired of Rabbah: “What is your reason?…Because of the birth pangs of the Messiah? But it has been taught, Rabbi Eleazar’s disciples asked him: ‘What must we do to be spared the birth pangs of the Messiah?’ ” (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 98b)13
Notice once again that Micah’s oracle is explicitly interpreted as a prophecy of “the Messiah.” Thus, the woman who gives birth is the mother of the Messiah. On the other hand, the Talmud also interprets the sufferings of the woman as a metaphor for the time of tribulation that will precede the coming of the Messiah. The rabbis refer to this time of suffering as the “birth pangs of the Messiah” (Hebrew heblo shel mashiah) (Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 98b). Apparently, some of them thought that the time of the Messiah would be so terrible that they were willing to miss it in order to be spared his “birth pangs.” In any case, for both Jewish texts, it is only after the time of suffering that the Messiah will finally rule over his universal kingdom that reaches to the ends of the earth.
To sum up what we’ve learned so far: If we turn to the pages of Jewish Scripture and tradition and focus our attention on prophecies of the Messiah’s birth, two apparently contrary pictures emerge. On the one hand, Isaiah prophesies that, at the time of the new creation, a woman will give birth to a son without the pain of childbirth that was part and parcel of the old creation. In later Jewish tradition, Isaiah’s prophecy was interpreted as being about the birth of the Messiah. On the other hand, Micah also prophesies about the mother of the Messiah, but in this case, he says that she will suffer the pains of “labor.” In later Jewish tradition, Micah’s prophecy was interpreted as being about the “birth pangs” of the Messiah—a time of suffering that would precede the age of salvation.
So what are we to make of these two prophecies? What do they reveal to us about Mary, the mother of Jesus? Did she or did she not suffer the birth pangs of the Messiah? In order to answer this question, we have to turn to the writings of the New Testament, in which the mysterious image of the birth pangs of the Messiah’s mother reoccurs in two key places: the book of Revelation and the Gospel of John.
MARY’S BIRTH PANGS
With these ancient Jewish prophecies and traditions in mind, we can now study the passages in the New Testament that describe Mary’s birth pangs and try to see them through ancient Jewish eyes. In this case, we will begin not with the Gospel accounts but by returning once more to John’s vision in the book of Revelation.
The Woman in Revelation: The “Birth Pangs” of the Crucifixion
By far the most explicit description of the birth pangs of Mary in the New Testament comes to us from John’s vision of the woman clothed with the sun who gives birth to a child who is caught up into heaven (Revelation 12:1–6). As we saw in Chapter 2, there are strong arguments for concluding that “the child” who is born is primarily an individual—Jesus the Messiah—and that the woman who gives birth to the child is also primarily an individual—Mary his mother.14 With this in mind, we can turn back to this passage one last time, this time focusing on the sufferings of the Messiah’s mother:
And a great portent appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; she was with child and she cried out in her pangs of birth, in anguish for delivery. And another portent appeared in heaven; behold, a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems upon his heads. His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child, that he might devour her child when she brought it forth; she brought forth a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne, and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which to be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days. (Revelation 12:1–6)
At first glance, it seems pretty clear that if the child represents Jesus, and the woman represents Mary, then the image of her crying out “in the pangs of her birth, in anguish for delivery” (Revelation 12:2) must be a description of the painful labor she suffered at Bethlehem. Indeed, over the years, I’ve noticed that this is how the passage is interpreted by many of my students, who often just assume without question that Mary gave birth in an ordinary way.
As contemporary scholars have pointed out, however, this passage is not a biography but an apocalyptic vision. Indeed, there are several reasons to think that the vision of the woman in anguish for delivery is not a literal depiction of what Mary suffered at Bethlehem, during the birth of Jesus, but a symbolic depiction of what Mary suffered at Calvary, during the crucifixion of Jesus.15
For one thing, the word used to describe the “anguish” or “torment” (Greek basanizō) of the Messiah’s mother is not normally used to describe the ordinary birth pains of a woman in labor (Revelation 12:2). As one New Testament scholar writes: “It is a fact that in the LXX [the Greek Old Testament], the New Testament, the Apocrypha, the papyri and the writings of the Fathers, there is not a single case in which the verb basanizō is used to refer to the pains of childbirth.”16 In the book of Revelation, the word is used to refer to “torment” or “torture” (Revelation 11:10, 9:5, 14:10, 20:10). The use of such an unusual term to describe the sufferings of the mother of the Messiah strongly suggests that Revelation is employing the language of symbolism. The imagery of birth pangs is being utilized to refer to “the tribulations at the end of the age.”17
Even more important, if we interpret the birth of the child as a literal description of what happened at Bethlehem, we find ourselves with a problem, since immediately after the “birth,” the child is “caught up to God and to his throne” in heaven (Revelation 12:5)! Where is the account of Jesus’ childhood and public ministry? They are absent, because this is not a literal description of the birth of Jesus. It is a symbolic description of Jesus’ death, resurrection, and ascension into heaven and his being seated at the right hand of God the Father.18
Finally, as both Protestant and Catholic commentators have pointed out, John’s description of the woman in anguish is directly based on Isaiah’s prophecy of the painless birth of the Messiah!19 Compare the following Greek parallels:
Mother of Messiah
Woman in Heaven
1. She who was in labor (ōdinousan)
1. She was in labor (ōdinousa)
2. She escaped (exephygen)
2. She escaped (ephygen)
3. She gave birth to a male (eteken arsen) (Isaiah 66:7 LXX)20
3. And she bore a male son (eteken huion arsen) (Revelation 12:2, 6, 5)
Now, if John wanted to emphasize that Mary suffered literal birth pangs, why would he allude to an Old Testament prophecy in which the mother of the Messiah escapes the pain of childbirth? I have a suggestion: because John is not interested in making sure you know Mary suffered pain in childbirth. He has a different goal. Revelation 12 is not a literal description of the mystery of the nativity; it is an apocalyptic depiction of the mystery of the cross. In the words of the French New Testament scholar André Feuillet: “The messianic birth of the Apocalypse refers directly not to the birth of Christ at Bethlehem, but to the mystery of Easter morning: the pains of childbirth correspond to Calvary.”21
In other words, the “anguish” of the woman in Revelation 12 is the anguish Mary experienced when she watched her son die on the hill of Golgotha.
The Gospel of John: The Woman’s “Hour” and the Crucifixion
Should there be any doubt about this connection between the death of Jesus and the “birth pangs” of Mary, it is important to turn to the pages of the other book attributed to John in the New Testament: the Fourth Gospel. For Revelation is not the only book in the New Testament that uses childbirth as a metaphor for the passion and death of Christ.
In the Gospel of John, during his discourse at the Last Supper, Jesus himself uses the image of a “woman” who suffers in childbirth as a metaphor for his coming passion, death, and resurrection.22 Although this mysterious passage is sometimes overlooked in discussions of Mary, it is extremely helpful for properly interpreting the meaning of the woman in labor in the book of Revelation:
[Jesus said to his disciples:] “A little while, and you will see me no more; again a little while, and you will see me…Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice; you will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. When a woman gives birth she has sorrow, because her hour has come; but when she is delivered of the child, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a child is born into the world. So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you.” (John 16:16, 20–22)
Notice here that Jesus is clearly referring to his coming death (“you will see me no more”) and resurrection (“you will see me”). In this context, he uses the mysterious image of a “woman” (Greek gynē) whose “hour” (Greek hōra) has come to give birth (John 16:21). While she is giving birth she will have “sorrow,” but when she finally gives birth, she will not remember her “anguish” because of the “joy”:
The Womanʼs Labor
Jesusʼ Crucifixion
1. Childbirth: Womans “hour”
1. Passion: Jesus “hour”
2. Labor Pains: she has “sorrow”
2. Death: brings “sorrow”
3. Delivery: she has “joy”
3. Resurrection: brings “joy”
As Jesus himself goes on to say, he is speaking to the disciples “in figures” (John 16:25)—that is, using metaphors. With that said, one has to ask: Isn’t this a rather strange metaphor? Given the utter brutality of a Roman crucifixion, widely regarded as the worst possible way to die, why would Jesus choose to compare his passion and death on the cross to the “hour” of a “woman” in childbirth?
On the one hand, you could simply suggest that Jesus is using this metaphor because childbirth is indeed an intense combination of extreme suffering and extreme joy. However, I would suggest that more is going on here. In the Gospel of John, the word “hour” (Greek hōra) is used as a kind of technical term referring to the mystery of Christ’s passion and death.23 Furthermore, Jesus’ use of the image of a woman giving birth appears to be drawing on the Jewish idea of the “birth pangs of the Messiah”—the time of suffering that will usher in the age of salvation.24 Jesus seems to be using the metaphor of the “woman’s hour” to point both to his sufferings on the cross and (in a special way) to the sufferings of Mary his mother. In support of this, look once again at John’s description of the death of Jesus:
But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. (John 19:25–27)
Did you see what just happened there? It was the fulfillment of Jesus’ words at the Last Supper. Just as Jesus had compared his passion and death to the labor and sorrow of a “woman” (Greek gynē) whose “hour” (Greek hōra) of childbirth has come (John 16:21), so now the crucifixion of Jesus becomes the “hour” (Greek hōra) of sorrow for Mary, whom Jesus addresses as “woman” (Greek gynē) (John 19:26). The use of these terms is not a coincidence. Precisely because Mary is Jesus’ mother, she suffers at the foot of the cross in a unique way, so that the death of Jesus becomes her “hour” as well—the hour of her motherly “anguish” and “sorrow” (cf. John 16:21).25 Indeed, Jesus’ prophecy about the woman’s “hour” may be the only reference in the New Testament that we possess to Mary’s experience of Jesus’ being raised from the dead. Although she has “sorrow” now, she will have “joy” at his resurrection.
MARY’S WOMB AND JESUS’ TOMB
I suspect that much of what we have covered in this chapter will come as a surprise to many readers. In my experience, most people are not aware that Jewish Scripture contains a prophecy of a woman who gives birth to the Messiah without any pain, and many are unfamiliar with the ancient Jewish belief that the age of salvation would be preceded by the “birth pangs” of the Messiah. Likewise, if my years in the classroom are any indication, virtually every student who reads Revelation’s description of the woman clothed with sun crying out in the “torment” of her delivery assumes that it is a literal description of the intense birth pangs suffered by Mary at Bethlehem. That is certainly how the labor pangs of Mary are always depicted in contemporary movies.
However, when we turn to ancient Christianity, the situation is very different. From the earliest centuries, ancient Christians believed that Isaiah’s prophecy of the painless birth was fulfilled in Mary at Bethlehem. In fact, they believed that, as the new Eve and the mother of the Messiah, Mary was spared the ordinary pain of childbirth precisely because she would not be spared the extraordinary pain of watching her son die upon the cross. Let’s bring this chapter to a close by taking a few moments to look at what ancient Christians believed about the miraculous birth of Jesus and why they thought it mattered.
The Painless Birth of Jesus: A Fulfillment of Isaiah’s Prophecy
On the one hand, as I’ve already noted, since ancient times it has been widely believed by Christians that Mary did not suffer the pains of ordinary childbirth. In other words, both the conception and the birth of Jesus were miraculous. Eventually, this ancient Christian idea developed into the belief in the virginal birth of Christ (see CCC 499).26
Where did ancient Christians get such an idea? By now, the answer should be obvious: They got it from the Old Testament prophecy of the painless birth of the Messiah (Isaiah 66:7–8). Over and over again, ancient Christian writers not only affirm that the birth of Jesus was miraculous but do so because they see his birth as a fulfillment of Isaiah’s prophecy. In fact, belief in the miraculous birth of Jesus goes back to one of the earliest writings we possess after the New Testament: a book by Irenaeus of Lyons that was intended to give a summary of the basic contents of the apostolic faith. It is also present in the writings of other ancient Christians, such as Gregory of Nyssa. Consider them both:
And concerning His birth, the same prophet [Isaiah] says in another place, “Before she who was in labour gave birth, and before the birthpains came on, she was delivered of a male child” (Isaiah 66:7); [thus] he indicated His unexpected and extraordinary birth from the Virgin. (Irenaeus, On the Apostolic Preaching, 54 [2nd century A.D.])27
Among the myriads of men born of Adam, succeeding him as long as his nature will continue through successive births, only [Jesus] came to light through a new way of being born…In fact, his birth alone occurred without labor pains, and he alone began to exist without sexual relations…Even the prophet Isaiah affirms that her giving birth was without pain, when he says: “Before the pangs of birth arrived, a male child came forth and was born” (Isa 66:7). (Gregory of Nyssa, On the Song of Songs 13 [4th century A.D.])28
Notice that in both examples, the belief in Mary’s freedom from birth pangs is directly based on the prophecy of the painless birth of the Messiah in Isaiah 66. Although many Christians nowadays may be unfamiliar with Isaiah’s oracle, ancient Christians knew the Jewish Scriptures extremely well and interpreted the life of Mary in light of both the New Testament and the Old Testament.29
Mary Did Suffer the “Birth Pangs” of the Crucifixion
On the other hand, ancient Christian writers are equally clear that the miraculous birth of Jesus did not mean that Mary didn’t have to suffer at all. Although Mary was spared the pangs of childbirth, she was not spared the anguish of watching her son die on the cross.
I know of no one who has expressed this belief more beautifully than the great Eastern Christian writer John Damascene. In his extremely influential book summarizing the universal and orthodox Christian faith, he has this to say:
So far as He was born of woman, His birth was in accordance with the laws of parturition, while so far as He had no father, His birth was above the nature of generation…For, as pleasure did not precede it, pain did not follow it, according to the prophet [Isaiah] who says, “Before she travailed, she brought forth, and again, before her pain came she was delivered of a man-child” (Isaiah 66:7)…But just as He who was conceived kept her who conceived still virgin, in like manner also He who was born preserved her virginity intact, only passing through her and keeping her closed…But this blessed woman, who was deemed worthy of gifts that are supernatural, suffered those pains, which she escaped at the birth, in the hour of the passion, enduring from motherly sympathy the rending of the bowels, and when she beheld Him, Whom she knew to be God by the manner of His generation, killed as a malefactor, her thoughts pierced her as a sword, and this is the meaning of this verse: “Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also” (Luke 2:35). But the joy of the resurrection transforms the pain, proclaiming Him, Who died in the flesh, to be God. (John Damascene, On the Orthodox Faith, 4.14 [8th century A.D.])30
Clearly, for John Damascene, the fact that Mary was spared what so many other women throughout human history have had to endure—with countless numbers dying in childbirth—does not suggest that she is somehow more than human, or that she floats above all the sufferings of this world. To the contrary, if we take seriously both the humanity and the divinity of Jesus, then the anguish suffered by Mary as she stood at the foot of the cross—an anguish which the book of Revelation describes as “torment” (Revelation 12:2)—is quite literally inconceivable. For Mary did not just watch her son perish; she watched the one whom she knew to be the Son of God slowly asphyxiate and die the most horrific and shameful of human deaths: death on a cross.
When the crucifixion is seen in this light, one could rightly suggest that Mary drank waters of sorrow more deeply than any other human mother ever has. In doing so, she has been enabled to identify with all mothers who suffer for their children. Just as Jesus is the one whom Isaiah calls the “man of sorrows” (Isaiah 53:4), so Mary as the mother of the Messiah can rightly be called the “mother of sorrows” (Latin Mater Dolorosa). This, as Pope John Paul II once wrote, is the deeper symbolism of the birth pangs of the woman in Revelation 12: “The woman clothed with the sun is in a certain sense identified with Mary,” for the imagery of “her pangs of birth” (Revelation 12:2) “refers to the Mother of Jesus at the Cross.”31
The Meaning of the Miraculous Birth
Of course, we still have to ask, Why does any of this matter? What meaning could the painless birth of Jesus possibly have? Why was what happened to Mary’s body during the birth of Jesus so important to these ancient Christian writers?
For one thing, like the virginal conception and other miracles, the virginal birth of Christ was seen as a sign of Jesus’ divinity. Perhaps the most famous example of this idea comes from the letter of Pope Leo I which was read aloud at the second ecumenical Council of Chalcedon (A.D. 451). In this letter, Leo not only affirmed the virginal conception and birth of Jesus; he also explained why they matter. According to Leo, they are signs that Jesus is both fully human and fully divine:
For he was conceived by the Holy Spirit within the womb of the Virgin Mother, who gave birth to him in such a way that her virginity was undiminished, just as she had conceived him with her virginity undiminished…The Son of God, therefore, descending from his heavenly throne, enters into the infirmities of this world; and, not leaving his Father’s glory, he is generated in a new order and a new birth…Nor does the Lord Jesus Christ, born from the womb of a virgin, have a nature different from ours just because his birth was miraculous. For he who is true God is likewise true man, and there is no falsehood in this unity, in which the lowliness of man and the height of divinity coincide…(Pope Leo I, The Tome to Flavian, 2, 4 [5th century A.D.])32
Note well that the “miraculous birth” (Latin nativitas mirabilis) of Jesus in no way detracts from the fullness of his humanity. Rather, it shows forth the paradox of the incarnation itself, in which the “lowliness” of being born of a woman “coincides” with the “height” of his divinity. As we’ve seen with other ancient Christians, what Leo believes about Mary is based on what he believes about Jesus. Since Jesus is both fully human and fully divine, we should expect him to both enter fully into the infirmities of this world and, at the same time, to come into the world with miracles that reveal he is more than just an ordinary man.33
Furthermore, the miraculous birth of Jesus was seen as a sign of the new creation. Think about it for a minute. If, as we saw in Chapter 2, Jesus is the new Adam and Mary is the new Eve, then it is fitting that Mary would give birth to Jesus without undergoing the pain that was the result of Eve’s sin. Consider the words of two of the most influential ancient Eastern Christian writers:
How would it have been possible for her…[to] give birth filled with birthpangs, in the image of the primeval curse? If Mary was “blessed of women” (Luke 1:42), she would have been exempt from the curse from the beginning, and from the bearing of children in birthpangs and curses. (Ephrem the Syrian, Commentary on the Diatesseron, 2.6 [4th century A.D.])34
[Christ’s] birth alone occurred without labor pains, and he alone began to exist without sexual relations…This happened for an understandable reason; there is nothing absurd about it. Just as she who introduced death into nature by sin was condemned to bear children in suffering and travail (Gen 3:16), it was necessary that the Mother of life, after having conceived in joy, should give birth in joy as well. (Gregory of Nyssa, On the Song of Songs 13 [4th century A.D.])35
Although modern-day people think of pain in childbirth as something “natural,” this is certainly not how ancient Christians saw it. They saw it through the lens of the Jewish Bible, in which the pangs of childbirth are the result of the first sin (Genesis 3:16). Hence, just as the ancient Jews believed that in the new creation women would no longer experience birth pangs, so ancient Christians believed that the nativity of Jesus itself was the beginning of the new creation. What they believed about Mary, the second Eve, flowed directly from what they believed about Jesus, the new Adam.
Finally, and perhaps most intriguing of all, the miraculous birth of Jesus was seen as a sign of his resurrection from the dead. In order to see this clearly, it’s important to remember two points. First—contrary to what you’ve probably seen in movies and artistic depictions of the resurrection—in the New Testament, the resurrected Jesus exits the tomb by passing through the gravestone. According to the Gospel of Matthew, when the women arrived at the tomb on Easter Sunday morning, the tomb of Jesus was still sealed. That’s why “an angel from heaven” came and “rolled back the stone” (Matthew 28:2). Second, in ancient Judaism, wombs and tombs were often compared to one another. For example:
Cursed be the man…[who] did not kill me in the womb;
so my mother would have been my grave,
and her womb forever great. (Jeremiah 20:15, 17)
Much labor was created for every man, and a heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam,
from the day they come forth from their mother’s womb, till the day they return to the mother of all. (Sirach 40:1)
Notice that in the last line, the earth itself is given the same name as Eve: “the mother of all [the living]” (Genesis 3:22)!36 In fact, the book of Sirach elsewhere describes death as entering into the “womb (Greek koilias) of Hades” (Sirach 51:5).
Once this idea of the “tomb” as a “womb” is clear, suddenly the link between the miraculous birth and the miraculous resurrection of Jesus makes sense. Although lots of examples from ancient Christian writers could be given,37 in my opinion, two of the most striking come from the pen of Ephrem the Syrian:
[The fact] that “they sealed the tomb” (Matt 27:66) was in [the Lord’s] favour…He took the body out from the tomb, although it was sealed, and the seal of the tomb witnessed in favour of the seal of the womb that had borne him. For it was when the virginity was sealed that the Son emerged alive from within her…(Ephrem, Commentary on the Diatesseron, 21.21 [4th century A.D.])38
In your Resurrection you made your birth comprehensible; since the womb was sealed, and the sepulcher closed up…The womb and the sepulcher being sealed were witnesses unto you. The womb of the Mother and hell cried aloud of your Resurrection: The womb conceived you, which was sealed; the tomb let you go forth which was closed up…(Ephrem, Hymns on the Nativity, 10.6–8 [4th century A.D.])39
In other words, for Ephrem, as for many other ancient Christians, the miraculous birth of Jesus from Mary’s womb is not some bizarre idea—though it is a “mystery” that is ultimately “above the capacity of our intelligence and our words” (Severus of Antioch, Homily 108).40 Instead, the miraculous birth is a sign that is meant to point forward to the even more miraculous exiting of the risen Jesus from the tomb! In the light of this mystery, the resurrection of Jesus becomes more than just a vindication of his power or divinity; it really is a kind of “birth,” by which he becomes “the first-born among many brethren” (Romans 8:28).
Of course, if Jesus is the firstborn son among many siblings, then doesn’t that suggest that Mary is not just his mother but our mother as well? To that question we will now turn, by looking at one final figure from Jewish Scripture and tradition—one who was also a woman of sorrow and joy: Rachel, the mother of Israel.
