               chapter 4
THE QUEEN MOTHER
As an American, I can safely say that I have no firsthand experience of what it means to belong to a “kingdom.” After all, the United States would not exist if the founding fathers had not engaged in a political revolution against the British monarchy. From a very young age, I was taught that democracy was the only sound form of government, and that monarchies were, as a rule, bad. As a result, I grew up with a kind of built-in suspicion of kings and queens, to say nothing of “empires”—kingdoms that conquer other nations. Indeed, one of the first movies I ever saw in the theater was Star Wars, in which the good guys are all part of “the Rebellion,” and the bad guys all belong to “the Empire.”
Despite my personal biases, the idea of a “kingdom”—a nation ruled by the sovereign heir of a royal family—is essential for understanding the Bible’s message of salvation. Think about it for a minute. At the very center of the Old Testament stands God’s promise to King David that the “throne” of David’s “kingdom” would be established “forever” (2 Samuel 7:13). In other words, God promises David an everlasting monarchy. Likewise, when we turn to the New Testament, Jesus himself defines the “gospel” in terms of the coming of a kingdom: “Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and saying…‘The kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel’ ” (Mark 1:14–15). In other words, Jesus is saying that the time has come for the empire of God—the kingdom that will rule over all the other nations of the world.1
The centrality of this ancient Jewish hope for an everlasting empire of God is why the New Testament opens with a detailed (some would say too detailed!) genealogy of Jesus (see Matthew 1:1–17). The whole point of the genealogy is to show Jesus is royalty; he is the heir to David’s throne. As the first line of the Gospel states:
The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. (Matthew 1:1)
Likewise, when the angel Gabriel appears to Mary, he explicitly links the birth of the child to the fulfillment of God’s promise to King David:
And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.” (Luke 1:30–33)
Taken as a whole, the New Testament clearly depicts Jesus as the long-awaited Davidic king—also known as “the Messiah” (Greek christos)—who has come to inaugurate the everlasting kingdom promised by God to David. Jesus isn’t just a new Adam, or a new Moses. He is also a new David.2
The reason all of this matters for us can be expressed in a simple question: If Jesus is the new Davidic king, then who is the new queen? Although modern-day Bible readers might not think of a queen when it comes to the kingdom of God, as any first-century Jew would have known, under the reign of David’s royal family, the kingdom was ruled by both a king and a queen. Unlike in modern-day kingdoms, however, the queen of Israel was not the king’s wife but his mother. She was known as the “queen mother” (Hebrew gebirah).
In this chapter, we will explore how the New Testament depicts Mary as the new queen mother of the kingdom of God. Moreover, we’ll see how her identity as the new gebirah has direct implications for Catholic and Orthodox beliefs about Mary as “mother of God,” as well as the ancient Christian practices of honoring Mary and asking for her intercession. In order to see all this clearly, however, we have to back up quite a bit and make sure we are familiar with the role and identity of the queen mother in the Old Testament and ancient Jewish tradition.
THE QUEEN MOTHER IN ANCIENT ISRAEL
I think it’s safe to say that of the many figures in the Jewish Bible, the “queen mother” is not one of the most familiar. One reason is that she does not appear until the books of 1 and 2 Kings, which tell the history of King David and his successors. For many readers, this part of the Bible is just not as familiar as the earlier books of Genesis and Exodus. Moreover, when the story of David and his kingdom is put into art or film, the figure of the queen mother is invariably left out. Nevertheless, during the time of the Davidic kingdom, the office of the “queen mother” was very significant. For our purposes here, four aspects of her role and identity stand out.
The Queen Is the King’s Mother
As I already noted, in contrast to most kingdoms, in ancient Israel, the “queen” of the kingdom was not the king’s wife but his mother.3 Her royal title—“queen mother” (Hebrew gebirah)—is the feminine form of the word “master” (Hebrew gebir). It can also be translated “great lady” or “mistress” (see 1 Kings 15:13; 2 Chronicles 15:16; Jeremiah 29:2).4 Indeed, in the historical books of the Old Testament, the queen mother holds a position of great honor. For example, in the genealogical introduction to each new king, it is the king’s mother, not his wife, who is mentioned (e.g., 1 Kings 15:1–2).
Nowhere is this clearer than in the story of the first queen mother: Bathsheba, the wife of David and the mother of King Solomon.5 While King David is still alive, his wife pays homage to him. For example, whenever Bathsheba comes into David’s presence, she “bows” to him, “does obeisance to the king,” and calls him “My lord” (Hebrew ’adoni) (1 Kings 1:16–17). Once King David is dead, however, and Bathsheba’s son Solomon sits on the royal throne, the roles are reversed.6 Now that her son is king, it is the king who honors his mother—not just by rising in her presence and bowing to her but by seating her on a royal “throne”:
So Bathsheba went to King Solomon, to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her, and bowed down to her; then he sat on his throne, and had a throne brought for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right. (1 Kings 2:19–20)7
It is hard to overestimate the significance of this passage for understanding the dignity possessed by the mother of the king. Although some English translations say that King Solomon has a “seat” brought for his mother, the actual word is “throne” (Hebrew kisse’; Greek thronos). It’s the exact same word used in the previous verse to describe Solomon’s “throne.”8 The obvious implication of seating his mother beside him on a throne is that she—and not his wife—is queen.
The Queen Mother Reigns with the King
Equally important, the mother of the king was not merely honored with the title of queen mother. She also held an “official position in the kingdom,” second in rank only to the king himself.9 In other words, the queen mother reigned alongside the king.
This royal authority of the queen mother was symbolized in two key ways. First, like the king, the queen mother wore a “crown.”10 Consider, for example, the oracle of the prophet Jeremiah against the king and his mother:
Say to the king and the queen mother:
“Take a lowly seat,
for your beautiful crown
has come down from your head.”
(Jeremiah 13:18)
Moreover, as we just saw in the story of King Solomon, the queen mother is seated at the “right hand” of the king (1 Kings 2:20). Something similar occurs in one of the Psalms of the “Sons of Korah,” which were written after the time of David. Psalm 45 describes the queen mother as standing “at the right hand” of the king:
Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever.
Your royal scepter is a scepter of equity;
you love righteousness and hate wickedness.
Therefore God, your God, has anointed you
with the oil of gladness above your fellows;
your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia.
From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad;
daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor;
at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.
(Psalm 45:6–9)11
As Old Testament scholars agree, the “queen” (Hebrew shegal; Greek basilissa) in this Psalm is the king’s mother, not one of his wives.12 The fact that she stands at the king’s “right hand” means that she has a share in his authority (Psalm 45:9), just as the king who sits at the “right hand” of God shares in God’s authority (Psalm 110:1). In the words of one Old Testament expert, after “the monarch himself,” the queen mother has “the place of highest honor” in the kingdom.13
The Queen Mother Is a Powerful Intercessor
According to the Old Testament, the queen mother was also a powerful intercessor with her son. This makes sense. If you want to obtain a request from the king, having his mother as your advocate is a very good idea.
Consider, for example, the story of Adonijah—one of David’s younger sons—who asks Bathsheba as queen mother to intercede for him with King Solomon:
Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, “Do you come peaceably?” He said, “Peaceably.” Then he said, “I have something to say to you.” She said, “Say on”…And he said, “Pray ask King Solomon—he will not refuse you—to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife.” Bathsheba said, “Very well; I will speak for you to the king.” (1 Kings 2:13–14, 17–18)
Notice here that Adonijah assumes that the queen mother will “speak to the king” on his behalf and that King Solomon “will not refuse” any request made by his mother. Unfortunately, Adonijah’s strategy ultimately does not work out, since Solomon has his brother put to death. Despite Solomon’s abuse of his power, the passage provides an important window into the queen mother’s role as royal advocate and intercessor.14
The Queen Mother Appears in Prophecies of the Future
Finally, the queen mother is not just someone who belongs to Israel’s past. She also appears in prophecies of the future king of Israel, later known as “the Messiah.” Let’s look at two examples.
First, there is the famous prophecy of the mother of “Immanuel.” In the early eighth century B.C., the prophet Isaiah goes to Ahaz the king and declares that God will give him the following miraculous “sign”:
The LORD spoke to [King] Ahaz, “Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” But Ahaz said, “I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test.” And he said, “Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also? Therefore the LORD himself will give you a sign. Behold, a maiden shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. (Isaiah 7:10–14)15
Throughout the centuries, Jewish and Christian commentators have vigorously debated the meaning of the miraculous “sign,” the connotation of the unusual word “maiden” (Hebrew ‘almah), and the identity of the child “Immanuel” (Hebrew for “God-with-us”). Does the prophecy refer to the natural conception and birth of King Hezekiah, during whose life the threat of an Assyrian invasion surprisingly ceased? Or does it refer to the miraculous conception and birth of a future king? Unfortunately, we do not have the space here to dive into this age-old debate.16 For our purposes, we need only make one basic point: However one interprets the prophecy, the “maiden” is the mother of the future king. As such, the mother of Immanuel would by definition also be the “queen mother.”
Second, there is the prophecy of the mother of the king from Bethlehem (Micah 5:2–3). Here the prophet Micah speaks of a future king who is a new David. Just as King David was born and raised in Bethlehem, so the future “ruler” will “come forth” from Bethlehem:
You, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose origin is from of old, from ancient days. Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who bears gives birth. (Micah 5:2–3)17
Notice here that although the future king comes from Bethlehem, his “origin” is actually “from ancient days” or “from days of eternity” (Hebrew mime ‘olam) (Micah 5:3). As one contemporary scholar points out, this verse suggests that “the Ruler will be a superhuman being, associated with God from the beginning of time.”18 Notice also the mysterious figure of “she who is in travail” or, more literally, “she who gives birth” (Micah 5:3).19 In context, this verse refers to the “human mother” of the future king and thus to the “birth of the Messiah.”20
In fact, several Old Testament scholars have suggested that Micah’s prophecy of the woman who will “give birth” to the Messiah in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2–3) is actually based on Isaiah’s earlier prophecy of the maiden who “gives birth” to Immanuel (Isaiah 7:10–14).21 If this is right, then the implications are enormous. For it would mean that the most ancient Hebrew interpretation of the birth of Immanuel that we possess saw Isaiah 7 as a prophecy of the Messiah, who will be born in Bethlehem.
In summary, in ancient Israel, the queen of the kingdom was the king’s mother. As the “great lady” (Hebrew gebirah), she not only wore a royal crown and sat on a royal throne, she also reigned with the king and held an office second only to that of the king himself. Small wonder then that when the prophets began to speak of the future king, the Messiah, they also spoke of the future queen mother. In light of this, one can easily imagine Jewish women in the first century not only wondering “Who will be the mother of the long-awaited Messiah?” but “Who will be the new queen mother?”
MARY THE NEW QUEEN
With all of this biblical background in mind, we can try once again to see Mary of Nazareth through ancient Jewish eyes. When we do so, we discover that Mary is much more than just the woman who happened to give birth to Jesus. She is also the queen mother of the Messiah’s kingdom.22 In order to see this clearly, we need to look carefully at the descriptions of Mary found in the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of Luke, and the book of Revelation.
The Gospel of Matthew: The Mother of Immanuel
The first evidence for seeing Mary as the new queen of the Messiah’s kingdom comes from the very first line of the New Testament: “The genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David” (Matthew 1:1).
As any first-century Jew would have known, if Jesus is the royal “Messiah” (Greek christos), then by definition, Mary, his mother, is the new queen.23 In support of this point, notice that Matthew actually names Mary at the end of Jesus’ royal genealogy:
Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ. So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations. (Matthew 1:16–17)
Although people frequently claim that Hebrew women were not usually included in ancient genealogies, this is not entirely true. As we saw before, in the Jewish Scriptures, one kind of woman was always named in the genealogical introductions to the reigns of the Davidic kings—the royal queen mother. In the books of Kings, almost every time a new king begins to reign, the name of his royal “mother” is given (see 1 Kings 14:21; 15:1–2, 9–10; 2 Kings 8:25–26; 12:1; 14:1–2; 15:1–2, 32–33; 18:1–2; 21:1, 19; 22:1; 23:31, 36; 24:7–8, 18).24 In the same way, Mary, the new queen mother, is named in the genealogical introduction to the new king, Jesus.25
Even more significant, in Matthew’s account of the virginal conception of Jesus, he explicitly identifies Joseph as a member of the royal family “of David” and Mary as the mother of “Immanuel,” who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah:
Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit; and her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to send her away quietly. But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit; she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: “Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel” (which means, God with us). When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took his wife, but knew her not until she had borne a son; and he called his name Jesus. (Matthew 1:18–23)
We will return—I promise—to the implications of this passage for Mary’s perpetual virginity in the next chapter. For now, the main point is this: Whatever contemporary commentators may think, Matthew clearly interprets Isaiah’s mysterious oracle about the mother of “Immanuel” (Isaiah 7:10–14) as a prophecy of the miraculous conception of the Messiah by an actual “virgin” (Greek parthenos).26 That is why Matthew emphasizes that Joseph “knew her not” before Jesus was born (Matthew 1:25).27 In other words, there is no possibility of Joseph having mistakenly fathered the child, since he refrained from marital relations with Mary while she was pregnant—even though he had already taken her to be his “wife.” As the legal wife of Joseph the “son of David” and the mother of “Immanuel,” from an ancient Jewish perspective, Mary is the royal queen mother. She is the mother of “God with us” (Matthew 1:23).
The Gospel of Luke: The “Mother of My Lord”
But Matthew is not the only book of the New Testament that highlights Mary’s identity as the royal queen mother. The same is true of the Gospel of Luke.
For one thing, as we saw earlier, in the account of the annunciation, Gabriel addresses Mary as the mother of the Davidic king: the child who will sit on “the throne of his father David” and whose “kingdom” will have no end (Luke 1:32). In Luke’s account of the visitation, Elizabeth even more clearly addresses Mary with a royal greeting:
And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.” (Luke 1:41–45)
In order to grasp the significance of Elizabeth’s words, it’s important to keep in mind that she was Mary’s elder “cousin” (Luke 1:36). In an ancient Jewish context, it would have been unheard of for an older relative to honor a younger cousin in this way—unless of course the younger person was royalty. Indeed, Elizabeth’s expression “the mother of my Lord” (Greek kyrios) (Luke 1:43) clearly echoes the biblical custom of referring to the Davidic king as “my lord” (Hebrew ’adon; Greek kyrios) (2 Samuel 24:21; Psalm 110:1).28 In light of this background, more than one scholar has concluded that Elizabeth is addressing Mary with a “royal title” rooted in “the queen mother tradition of the Old Testament.”29 Perhaps even more striking, the Jewish scholar Amy-Jill Levine suggests that Elizabeth’s reference to my “Lord” (Greek kyrios) is in fact a “divine title.”30 If this is right, then for Luke, Mary is not just the mother of the messianic king; she is also the mother of the divine Lord.
In addition to Elizabeth’s greeting, in Mary’s own song of praise to God—which came to be known as the Magnificat (from the Latin word for “magnify”)—she implies that she and her child have been exalted to sit upon royal “thrones.” With the question of Mary’s status as queen mother in mind, reread her famous words:
And Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord,
and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,
for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden.
For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed;
for he who is mighty has done great things for me…
He has put down the mighty from their thrones,
and exalted those of low degree;
he has filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he has sent empty away. (Luke 1:46–49, 52–53)
Notice here that when Mary declares that God has “exalted those of low degree” (Greek tapeinous) (Luke 1:52), in context, she is referring first and foremost to herself, since she has already spoken about how God looked upon “the low estate” (Greek tapeinōsin) of his “handmaiden” (Luke 1:48). Mary is the personal embodiment of the poor and the lowly in Israel.31 Notice also that when Mary says God has put down the mighty from their “thrones” (Greek thronōn), this is royal language. It is kings and queens who sit on “thrones,” and when they are “put down” from their thrones, others must take their place.32 Finally, when Mary uses the language of “all generations” calling her “blessed” (Luke 1:48), it sounds like the kind of thing said about royalty in the Jewish Bible. For example, Psalm 45 declares that the name of the king will be “celebrated in all generations” (Psalm 45:17).33
In short, Mary’s Magnificat implies that, although in the eyes of the world she is just a lowly “handmaiden,” both she and her son have been exalted to sit upon the “thrones” of the Davidic king and his mother.
The Book of Revelation: The Queen “in Heaven”
Last, but certainly not least, there is the evidence from the book of Revelation. Although we’ve already looked at the woman in Revelation 12 with reference to Eve and to the heavenly Ark, we need to go back once again and explore her royal identity:
And a great portent appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; she was with child and she cried out in her pangs of birth, in anguish for delivery…She brought forth a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron (Revelation 12:1–2, 5)
As I argued in Chapter 2, there are solid reasons for concluding that the “woman” in this vision symbolizes Mary, the mother of the Messiah, and the people of God.34 With this premise in mind, the description of the woman in Revelation 12 sheds important light on Mary’s identity as queen mother in three ways.
The first one is fairly obvious. The “woman” who is clothed with the sun is also wearing “a crown of twelve stars” (Revelation 12:2). Although in modern times simply winning a beauty pageant can qualify a woman for wearing a “crown,” in ancient times, it was not so. A crown was one of the symbols of royal identity and authority. In the case of Revelation 12, this is indisputable, since the crown consists of “twelve stars”—which clearly symbolize the twelve tribes of Israel (cf. Genesis 37:9–10).35 Seen in this light, the woman clothed with the sun is nothing less than the queen of the people of God, with her crown representing “a share in Christ’s kingship.”36
Second, the description of the woman in Revelation 12 appears to be based on Isaiah’s prophecy about the mother of “Immanuel” (Isaiah 7:13–14). Consider, for example, the following parallels:
Mother of Immanuel
Woman Clothed with the Sun
1. A sign…in the height
1. A sign…in the heaven, a woman
2. The virgin will be with child
2. She was with child
3. And she will give birth to a son (Isaiah 7:13–14)
3. She gave birth to a son (Revelation 12:1–2, 5)
In light of such parallels—which are even clearer in Greek—there are good reasons to conclude that Revelation is depicting the woman clothed with the sun as the “maiden” mother of Immanuel in Isaiah 7:14.37 If this is correct, then the implications are enormous. For one thing, it strengthens the conclusion that Revelation 12 is referring to an individual woman. After all, according to the New Testament, the only “virgin” who ever conceived and gave birth to the Messiah was Mary the mother of Jesus (Matthew 1:18–25). Moreover, it suggests that Matthew was not the only first-century writer who interpreted Isaiah’s prophecy of the birth of Immanuel with reference to the Messiah and his mother. John of Patmos did too. Last, but not least, it drives home the point that the mother of Immanuel in Isaiah 7 is not just any woman but the royal queen mother.
Third and finally—and this is important—the woman clothed with the sun and wearing a crown of stars is standing above the moon and the stars “in heaven” (Revelation 12:1). Her location matters because it presents a strong parallel with Jesus’ being “caught up” to the “throne” of God in heaven (Revelation 12:5; cf. 4:2). Just as Jesus is a heavenly king who reigns over a heavenly kingdom, so Mary, Jesus’ mother, is a heavenly queen. According to the portrait of Jesus’ mother in the book of Revelation, she can rightly be described as the queen of the kingdom of heaven. In the words of one Protestant expert on the book of Revelation, she is “the queen of the cosmos.”38
In sum, when we look at the New Testament in the light of ancient Jewish beliefs about the kings and queens of Israel, we can see very clearly that the mother of Jesus is repeatedly depicted as the queen mother of the kingdom of God. With this in mind, we can now ask the question So what? What are the theological implications of this New Testament evidence?
MOTHER OF “GOD WITH US”
The New Testament portrait of Mary as the virgin mother of Immanuel and the queen mother of the kingdom of God provides us with the biblical foundations for three central but controversial ancient Christian beliefs and practices: (1) Mary’s identity as “Mother of God” (Greek Theotokos); (2) honoring Mary and asking for her intercession; and (3) the difference between the veneration of Mary and the worship of God. Let’s take a few moments to look at each of these carefully.
Mother of God
First and foremost, if Mary is in fact the queen mother of Jesus, the divine king, then she is rightly referred to as the “Mother of God.” Since ancient times, Christians have given Mary the title of “God Bearer” (Greek Theotokos)—commonly translated into English as “Mother of God”—in order to emphasize the truth of Jesus’ divinity.39
Consider, for example, the testimony of the famous ancient Christian writer Athanasius of Alexandria, who gives us one of the first indisputable references to Mary as “Mother of God.”40 In his treatise against the Arian heretics, who denied the full divinity of Jesus, Athanasius insists that God became man and that therefore Mary is the “God-bearer”:
It was for our sake that Christ became man, taking flesh from the Virgin Mary, Mother of God (Theotokos). (Athanasius, Against the Arians 3.29 [4th century A.D.])41
One reason Athanasius’ testimony is so significant is that he is widely respected by Catholics, Orthodox, and Protestant Christians alike as the leading defender of orthodox teaching on Jesus’ divinity. To this day, even Protestants appeal to the writings of Athanasius as the first church father to give us the list of twenty-seven books of the New Testament that all Christians accept as Scripture.42
But Athanasius was not the only Christian of his day to refer to Mary as “Mother of God.” In the words of one of his contemporaries:
If anyone does not admit that holy Mary is Mother of God (Theotokos), he is cut off from the Godhead. (Gregory of Nazianzen, Letter 101 [4th century A.D.])43
For ancient Christians such as Athanasius and Gregory of Nazianzen, to deny that Mary was the “Mother of God” was in effect to deny the central truth of Christianity: that God himself became fully human while remaining fully divine. Eventually, in order to respond to attacks on the divinity of Jesus, Christian bishops from around the world gathered at the Council of Ephesus in A.D. 431 and solemnly proclaimed that Christ was truly God and that Mary was therefore the “Mother of God” (Theotokos).44 Indeed, the decree of the Council of Ephesus is the premier example of how ancient Christians’ beliefs about Mary were ultimately based on what they believed about Jesus. From that day to this, the truth of Jesus’ divinity and Mary’s identity as Theotokos continues to be confessed by Catholics and Orthodox alike as an essential teaching of the apostolic Christian faith, precisely because it safeguards the truth of the incarnation (see CCC 466, 495).45
Unfortunately, many modern-day Christians misunderstand the meaning of calling Mary “Mother of God.” Some think it means that Mary is somehow “equal to” or “greater than” God. Others think it implies that Mary is not fully human, or that she is the “Mother of the Trinity”! Nothing could be further from the truth. I cannot stress the point enough: The title “Mother of God” (Theotokos) does not mean—nor did it ever mean—that Mary is in any way a divine person. She is a mere human being, a creature. Furthermore, Mary is not the mother of God the Father; nor is she the mother of the Holy Spirit—much less of the entire Trinity. What Theotokos means is that Mary is the mother of the divine Son who became man. Once again, the title “Mother of God” is meant to illuminate the mystery of the incarnation.
Nevertheless, many Protestant Christians still object that the title is unbiblical. After all, the words “Mother of God” are never applied to Mary in the New Testament. Where did ancient Christians get this language? Why refer to Mary this way when the Bible itself does not? In response to these objections, I want to make two quick but important points.
Although the New Testament does not call Mary the “mother of God,” Elizabeth, inspired by the Holy Spirit, does refer to Mary as “the mother of my Lord” (Luke 1:43). As we saw earlier, both Jewish and Christian scholars agree that, in context, Elizabeth’s use of “Lord” refers to Jesus’ kingship and his divine identity.46 If this is correct, then the New Testament identification of Mary as the “mother” (Greek mētēr) of the “Lord” (Greek kyrios) provides a biblical foundation for the Church’s teaching that Mary is also the “Mother of God.”47
Next, it’s important to remember that the title given to Mary at the Council of Ephesus was not exactly “Mother of God” but “God Bearer” (Greek Theotokos).48 Far from being “unbiblical,” Theotokos is a compound word that comes straight from the Bible. In order to see this, it’s important to know a little Greek. The Greek word for “God” is theos, and the word “bearer” (Greek tokos) comes from the verb “to bear” (Greek tiktō). With this in mind, look closely again at the Gospel of Matthew:
“A virgin shall conceive and bear (Greek tiktō) a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel,” which means, God (Greek theos) with us. (Matthew 1:23)
There it is, right there, on the first page of the New Testament! Mary is the virgin who will “bear” (tiktō) the child who is “God (theos) with us.” In other words, Mary is the “God-bearer” (Greek Theo-tokos)! It is no wonder that it was ancient Greek-speaking Christians who came up with this title for Mary. They were reading the New Testament in the original Greek—not in translation. And they were reading it in light of the Old Testament. For it is the prophet Isaiah who was the first to speak of a woman “bearing” a child named “God with us” (Isaiah 7:14). In fact, Athanasius himself explicitly connects the title “God-bearer” to Isaiah’s prophecy of the mother of Immanuel.49 In short, when we read the New Testament in light of the Old Testament, Mary is indeed the mother of “God with us.”
Veneration and Intercession
Second, if Mary is the queen mother of the kingdom of God, then it is fitting for Christians to give her the honor due to the queen of Christ’s kingdom. And if Mary the queen is alive “in heaven” (Revelation 12:1), then it makes sense for Christians to ask her to pray for them and intercede on their behalf with Jesus the king. In other words, the fact that Mary is the new queen mother provides the biblical foundations for the ancient Christian practice of venerating Mary and asking for her intercession.50
Think about it for a minute. Even modern-day secular nations give honor to their presidents, prime ministers, and other appointed leaders. If earthly kingdoms are right to bestow honor on earthly leaders, then how much more fitting is it to give honor to the heavenly king of the universe and his royal mother? Again, even in our own day, those who seek the aid of government leaders often ask the people closest to them to intercede on their behalf. How much more sense does it make for Christians to ask someone as close to Jesus as Mary was (and is) to intercede on their behalf? After all, the Bible commands us to “pray for one another” (James 5:16). Why should such prayers cease in heaven (cf. Revelation 5:8)?
This, at least, is how ancient Christians understood the practice of honoring Mary as queen and asking for her prayers. Consider the words of an anonymous ancient Christian prayer that was discovered on a fragment of papyrus in Egypt:
We take refuge in your mercy, Mother of God (Greek Theotokos). Do not disregard our prayers in troubling times, but deliver us from danger, O only pure one, only blessed one. (Anonymous Christian prayer [3rd–4th century A.D.])51
In addition to this ancient Christian prayer to Mary as “Mother of God,” we have solid evidence from the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. that Christians who believed in the divinity of Jesus also asked for Mary’s intercession. For example, the Eastern church father Gregory of Nazianzen praises a Christian virgin named Justina, who in the face of danger, “took refuge in God” and spent time “imploring the Virgin Mary to bring her assistance, since she too was a virgin and in danger” (Gregory of Nazianzen, Sermon 24.9–11).52 Perhaps even more striking, the ancient Christian historian Sozomen tells us that in the church at Constantinople, “the power of God” was demonstrated by the healing of “many diseases,” and that “the power was accredited to Mary, the Mother of God, the holy virgin, for she does manifest herself in this way” (Sozomen, Ecclesiastical History 7.5.3).53
Notice the direct link in these examples between belief in the divinity of Jesus, Mary’s identity as “Mother of God,” and asking for her intercession. It is precisely because she is both the mother of Jesus and the queen of the kingdom that it makes sense to honor her and to ask for her prayers. In the words of one influential Eastern Christian writer:
Must there not therefore be a Mother of God who bore God incarnate? Assuredly she who played the part of the Creator’s servant and mother is in all strictness and truth in reality God’s Mother and Lady and Queen over all created things. (John Damascene, On the Orthodox Faith, 4.14 [8th century A.D.])54
Neither the human tongue nor the mind of the angels that live beyond this universe can give worthy praise to her, through whom it has been granted us to gaze clearly on the glory of the Lord…Let us, in holy reverence, with trembling hand and yearning soul, pay gratefully the humble first-fruits of our minds, as we must, to the Queen Mother, the benefactress of all nature! (John Damascene, Homily on the Dormition 1, no. 2 [8th century A.D.])55
Notice here that the title “Our Lady” comes from the Greek word for a royal “Lady” (Greek kyria), the “Queen” (Greek despozousa). Thus, Mary is “Our Lady,” the “Queen over all created things,” because Jesus actually is king of the universe—not because ancient Christians sold out to paganism. In point of fact, there was no need for ancient Christians to borrow the idea of a queen from paganism, since they had already gotten it from Judaism.
Once again, this ancient Christian belief in Mary’s queenship is very much alive today. In 1950, when Pope Pius XII defined the dogma of Mary’s bodily assumption into heaven, he declared that she had been “exalted by the Lord as Queen over all things, so that she might be the more fully conformed to her Son, the Lord of lords” (CCC 966).56 From ancient times to the present, the veneration of Mary and the custom of asking for her intercession have flowed directly from her identity as the heavenly queen of the kingdom of Christ.
Honoring Mary Versus Worshiping God
Third and finally, ancient Christians who honored Mary and asked for her intercession did not “worship” her as if she were God. In fact, the very same Christians who honored her with the title “Mother of God” also completely rejected the idea of worshiping Mary as blasphemy and idolatry.57
The clearest example of this comes from the ancient Christian writer Epiphanius of Salamis. At the end of his massive book against heresies, Epiphanius condemns one ancient sect for worshiping Mary as if she were divine.58 He refers to this group as the Collyridians, because they worshiped Mary by offering a sacrificial “loaf” (Greek kollyra) of eucharistic bread to her.59 Here are Epiphanius’ own words:
They say that certain Thracian women there in Arabia…bake a loaf in the name of the Ever-virgin [Mary], gather together, and both attempt an excess and undertake a forbidden, blasphemous act in the holy Virgin’s name, and offer sacrifice in her name with woman officiants. This is entirely impious, unlawful, and different from the Holy Spirit’s message, and is thus pure devil’s work, and the doctrine of an unclean spirit…Mary should be honored, but the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit should be worshiped; no one should worship Mary. There is no commandment to offer the Eucharist even to a man, as though to God, let alone to a woman; not even angels are allowed such glory…Such women should be silenced by Jeremiah, and not frighten the world. They must not say, “We honor the queen of heaven (Jeremiah 51:18)”…Mary is to be held in honor, but the Lord is to be worshiped! (Epiphanius, Panarion 78.23, 4; 79.7, 5; 8, 3; 9, 4 [4th century A.D.])60
Notice here that Epiphanius not only condemns the “worship” (Greek proskyneō) of Mary by the Collyridians as heresy and idolatry. He even uses the prophet Jeremiah’s passage about the “Queen of Heaven”—the same passage used by my wife’s Baptist pastor all those years ago—to describe what they’re doing! At the very same time, Epiphanius is equally insistent that Mary should be held “in honor” (Greek timē).
What is the difference between “honor” and “worship”? In context, the answer is clear: the offering of sacrifice. In both ancient Judaism and ancient Christianity—in fact, in most ancient religions—the essence of worship was sacrifice. To be sure, showing signs of honor (such as kneeling or prostration), asking for help or intercession (in prayer), and praising (usually through songs) were standard parts of worship. However, you could do any of those things—honor, beseech, praise—to human beings as well. (Think here of the honors given to a human king.) The one action that was reserved for God—and God alone—was the offering of sacrifice. For Epiphanius, therefore, the Collyridians were committing idolatry by offering the sacrificial bread of the Eucharist to Mary.
With that said, I must insist here in the strongest possible terms that this is precisely what Catholics and Orthodox Christians do not do. They do not offer sacrifice to Mary; they do not offer the Eucharist to her. This is the fundamental difference between the Christian veneration of Mary and the Christian adoration of God. In the words of the Catechism of the Catholic Church:
The Church rightly honors (Latin honoratur) “the Blessed Virgin with special devotion. From the most ancient times the Blessed Virgin has been honored with the title of ‘Mother of God,’ to whose protection the faithful fly in all their dangers and needs…This very special devotion…differs essentially from the adoration (Latin adorationis) which is given to the incarnate Word and equally to the Father and the Holy Spirit, and greatly fosters this adoration.” (CCC 971)61
In my opinion, the failure to distinguish between the honoring of a human being (which can involve signs of reverence and even songs of praise) and the adoration of God (which involves the offering of sacrifice) is one of the main reasons Protestants so often equate Catholic veneration of Mary with idolatry. In traditional Protestantism, worship is largely centered on doxology: prayer and songs of praise.62 There is no ministerial priesthood, and therefore no offering of sacrifice. For Catholics and Orthodox Christians, however, worship consists above all in the offering of the Eucharist.63 And the Eucharist is always offered to God alone. Since ancient times, Christians have recognized the fundamental difference between the devotion given to Mary and the adoration given to God. Christians have long honored her as the royal queen “Mother of God,” but they do not worship her as God.64
With this in mind, we can turn at last to yet another controversial belief: the idea that Mary not only conceived Jesus while a virgin but also remained a virgin for the rest of her life.
