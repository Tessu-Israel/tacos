            <h2>Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary</h2>
            <p>
               chapter 2
THE NEW EVE
As I said in Chapter 1, if you are going to understand who Mary is, you have to begin with Jesus. When it comes to the mission and message of Jesus, at the very center is “the Gospel”: the “good news” (Greek euangelion) of salvation (Mark 1:14–15).
But what exactly is the “Gospel”? If you’re anything like me, when I was a child I simply assumed that the “good news” was that Jesus the Savior had died for my sins so that I could go to heaven when I died. In other words, the bad news was that I was a sinner, but the good news was that Jesus offered me forgiveness. And to be sure, according to the New Testament, the forgiveness of sins is an essential part of Jesus’ message. As he says to his disciples during the Last Supper: “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins” (Matthew 26:28).
However, the older I got, and the more I studied the New Testament, the more I began to realize that the “good news” of salvation is about much more than just the forgiveness of my personal sins. It is about the forgiveness of the very first sin—the sin of Adam and Eve—through which suffering and death came into the world. According to the New Testament, Jesus is the new Adam, whose obedience undoes the disobedience of the first Adam.1 Nowhere is this expressed more clearly than in the writings of the apostle Paul, who has this to say about Adam and Jesus:
As one man’s trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one man’s act of righteousness leads to acquittal and life for all men. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so by one man’s obedience many will be made righteous. (Romans 5:18–19)
Thus it is written, “The first man Adam became a living being”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit…The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven. (1 Corinthians 15:45, 47)
Once you begin to see Jesus as Paul saw him—as the “last Adam”—it changes the way you think about the “good news” of salvation. If Jesus is the new Adam, then salvation is not just about saving sinners from the fires of hell. It is about undoing the effects of the Fall of Adam and Eve. It is about restoring the original “righteousness” which Adam had when he was created but which he lost through disobedience (Romans 5:17). It is about the power of God’s “grace” to actually “make” human beings “righteous” (Romans 5:19).2
What does any of this have to do with Mary? The answer is simple: If Jesus is the new Adam, then who is the new Eve? According to the book of Genesis, Adam is not the only human being created by God and placed in the Garden of Eden. Moreover, Adam does not bring sin and death into the world alone. As Adam’s partner, Eve plays an essential role in bringing about the fall of humankind.
In this chapter, we will begin our study of the Jewish roots of Mary by looking at how the New Testament depicts Mary as a new Eve. Once we begin to see Mary in this light, we will also begin to understand why ancient Christians did not believe she was just an ordinary woman. In particular, we will be able to understand why some of them believed that Mary, though fully human, was sinless. In order to see all this clearly, however, we have to go back to the beginning, and look a little more closely at the first Eve.
THE WOMAN IN EDEN
When it comes to the first woman in the Bible, an entire book could easily be written.3 For our purposes here, I just want to make four key points about the figure of Eve in Jewish Scripture and ancient Jewish tradition.
Adam and Eve Are Created “Very Good”
First, according to the Jewish Bible, God creates the first man and the first woman in a state of moral goodness and immortality. Consider the two accounts of creation in the book of Genesis:
So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them. And God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply…” And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. (Genesis 1:27–28, 31)
The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “You may freely eat of every tree of the garden; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die”…[Then] the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh; and the rib which the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man. Then the man said, “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.” (Genesis 2:15–17, 21–23)
Notice here that not only are Adam and Eve created in God’s “image” and “likeness”; they are also created “very good” (Hebrew tōv meōd) (Genesis 1:31). As one prominent Old Testament scholar points out, this Hebrew expression means that man and woman are created “just” or “morally good.”4 In other words, they are created without sin. Notice also that they are given the gift of immortality. When God says that they may “freely eat” of any tree in the garden, this includes the fruit of the “tree of life,” which—if they eat of it—they will “live forever” (Genesis 2:16, 9, 22).5 Finally, it is worth noting that before the Fall, the woman is never actually called “Eve.” She is simply called “woman.” As Adam declares: “She shall be called Woman (Hebrew ’ishah), because she was taken out of Man (Hebrew ’ish)” (Genesis 2:23). If you keep reading Genesis, you will discover that Adam does not give her the name Eve until after they commit the first sin (Genesis 3:20).
Adam and Eve Fall Together
Second, according to the book of Genesis, Eve invites Adam to eat the forbidden fruit. This first sin is commonly referred to as “the Fall,” even though the Bible itself does not use this language. While the story is very familiar, let’s look at it again and pay close attention to what it does (and does not) say:
Now the serpent was more subtle than any other wild creature that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, “Did God say, ‘You shall not eat of any tree of the garden’?” And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden; but God said, ‘You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.’ ” But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.” So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate. (Genesis 3:1–6)6
Contrary to what some artistic depictions suggest, Eve is not alone when she commits the first sin. As Genesis makes very clear, once Eve eats the fruit, she gives some to Adam, “who was with her (Hebrew ‘immah)” (Genesis 3:6).7 In other words, Adam and Eve fall together. Eve cooperates with Adam, and Adam cooperates with Eve. Neither acts in isolation from the other.
This of course explains why both Adam and Eve suffer the effects of the first sin. To the woman God says: “I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children” (Genesis 3:16). To the man he says: “In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return” (Genesis 3:19). This last line echoes God’s earlier warning about what will happen if the man eats from the forbidden tree: “you shall surely die” (Genesis 2:16). Indeed, because of their actions, they are driven out of the Garden of Eden; as a result, they are unable any longer to eat of “the tree of life, and live forever” (Genesis 3:22). Through the first act of disobedience to God, Adam and Eve lose the gift of the original goodness and immortality in which they were created and bring upon themselves the sufferings of fruitless toil, pain in childbirth, and ultimately, death itself.8
The Battle Between the “Serpent” and the “Woman”
Third, it is not just the man and the woman who are affected by their sin. The real culprit, the serpent, is also punished. In fact, part of the serpent’s punishment involves a cryptic oracle about a future battle between the offspring of the serpent and the offspring of the woman:
The LORD God said to the serpent,
“Because you have done this…
I will put enmity between you and the woman,
and between your seed and her seed;
he shall strike your head,
and you shall strike his heel.”
(Genesis 3:14–15)9
What are we to make of this mysterious oracle? On the one hand, many modern commentators see it as simply a story about the origin of the uneasy relationship between human beings and snakes. On the other hand, as we will see in a moment, ancient Jewish interpreters saw it as referring to a spiritual battle between humanity and the Devil and his angels. In support of this spiritual interpretation, it is worth noting that in the very next chapter of Genesis, “sin” is described as a beast “lurking at the door,” waiting to strike at Cain, the offspring of Eve. But he must “master” it (Genesis 4:1, 7).10
For our purposes here, what matters is that the oracle describes a future conflict between the serpent and the woman. When God declares that he will put “enmity” or “hostility” between the serpent and the woman, the Hebrew word refers to lethal conflict between individuals (Numbers 35:21–22) or war between peoples (see Ezekiel 25:15; 35:5). Indeed, this war between the serpent and the woman will not stop; the battle will continue between the “seed” or “offspring” (Hebrew zera’) of both the serpent and the woman. In other words, there are four parties involved in the battle:
The Battle in Genesis 3:15
1. The Serpent
versus
2. The Woman
3. Serpentʼs offspring (strikes the heel)
versus
4. Womanʼs offspring (crushes the head)
As anyone who has ever killed a snake knows, the safest way to do so is to crush its head. At the same time, if you try to step on its head, you take a fairly big risk of being struck on the heel before killing it. When it comes to the oracle in Genesis 3:15, the mysterious thing about the battle is that both sides appear to lose: The serpent’s offspring will “strike” (Hebrew suph) the human’s heel, and the woman’s offspring will “strike” (Hebrew suph) the serpent’s head.
Eve in Ancient Jewish Tradition
Finally, before turning to the New Testament, we need to take a brief look at what writings outside the Jewish Bible have to say about Eve. Although these books are not considered inspired Scripture by Jews today (though two of them—Wisdom and Sirach—were included in the Septuagint and are part of the Catholic Old Testament), they are nonetheless valuable witnesses to what many Jews living at the time of Mary and Jesus would have believed. Several aspects of ancient Jewish traditions about Eve stand out as important.11
For one thing, although the book of Genesis itself simply refers to “the serpent” (Genesis 3:1), later Jewish writings make clear that the one who tempts Eve is actually Satan.12 For example, the book of Wisdom states that it was “through the devil’s (Greek diabolos) envy that death entered the world” (Wisdom 2:24). Likewise, another first-century Jewish interpretation says that “the devil” spoke to Eve “through the mouth of the serpent” (Life of Adam and Eve 17:4).13
Moreover, ancient Jewish writings also affirm that the effects of Adam and Eve’s sin—sin and death—are transmitted to all their descendants.14 Consider the following examples, all from Jewish writings in circulation by the first century:
From a woman sin had its beginning, and because of her we all die. (Sirach 25:24)
[God said:] “That man transgressed my ways and was persuaded by his wife; and she was deceived by the serpent. And then death was ordained for the generations of men.” (Pseudo-Philo, Biblical Antiquities, 13:8)15
O Adam, what have you done? For though it was you who sinned, the fall was not yours alone, but ours also who are your descendants. (4 Ezra 7:118)16
Clearly, around the time of Jesus, there was a widespread Jewish tradition that the Fall of Adam and Eve affected all human beings, even though their descendants were not personally guilty. In other words, these Jewish writings lay the foundations for what would later come to be known as the doctrine of “original sin.”17
Finally, and most important of all, the oldest Jewish interpretations that we possess of the biblical oracle about the “serpent” and the “woman” (Genesis 3:15) saw it as a prophecy of the Messiah. The most significant example of this is the book of Enoch, which was very popular among Jews in the first century A.D. This ancient Jewish writing not only identifies the “Messiah” with the “Son of Man” (1 Enoch 48:2–10) but also links the Son of Man with the prophecy of the woman in Genesis 3:15:
Pain shall seize them when they see that Son of Man sitting on the throne of his glory…For the offspring of the mother of the living was concealed from the beginning (1 Enoch 62:5–7)18
What a remarkable passage! It shows us that already in the first century A.D., the Jewish Messiah was being identified with the “offspring” of Eve, the “mother of all living” (Genesis 3:15, 22). And this Jewish tradition did not stop in the first century. One ancient Jewish translation of Genesis into Aramaic (known as a Targum) also interprets the war between the woman and the serpent as a reference to the Messiah:
I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your sons and her sons…For her sons, however, there will be a remedy, but for you, O serpent, there will not be a remedy, since they are to make appeasement in the end, in the day of King Messiah. (Targum Neofiti on Genesis 3:15)19
Although the exact date of this Targum continues to be debated,20 for our purposes here, what matters is that it proves that ancient Christians were not the only ones who saw Genesis 3:15 as a Messianic prophecy. Ancient Jews did too. Thus, the Christian tradition of referring to Genesis 3:15 as the “First Gospel” (Latin Protoevangelium) is actually rooted in Jewish soil.21
To sum up, in ancient Jewish Scripture and tradition, Eve was no “ordinary woman.” Not only did she play a crucial role in bringing sin and death into the world but it was one of her offspring—the Messiah—who was expected to rise up one day and undo the effects of the Fall. With this in mind, we can now turn and see what light these ancient Jewish beliefs about Eve can shine on the figure of Mary.
MARY THE NEW EVE
When we turn to the pages of the New Testament, we find Mary depicted in ways that echo the biblical portrait of Eve and the mysterious “woman” of Genesis 3:15. This happens in two books: the Gospel of John and the book of Revelation. Let’s take a few moments to look carefully at each of them.
The Wedding at Cana and the “Woman” of Genesis
In the Gospel of John, Mary appears twice: once during the wedding at Cana (John 2:1–12), and once during the crucifixion of Jesus (John 19:25–27). When these two episodes are read alongside one another in light of ancient Jewish beliefs about Adam and Eve, they reveal clues that Mary is the “woman” of Genesis whose “offspring” will conquer the serpent (Genesis 3:15). Let’s begin with the wedding at Cana:
On the third day there was a marriage at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there; Jesus also was invited to the marriage, with his disciples. When the wine failed, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.” And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come.” His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.” Now six stone jars were standing there, for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. Jesus said to them, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim. He said to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the steward of the feast.” So they took it. When the steward of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward of the feast called the bridegroom and said to him, “Every man serves the good wine first; and when men have drunk freely, then the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.” This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him. (John 2:1–11)22
For our purposes here, two questions demand our attention. Why does the Gospel emphasize that the wedding at Cana took place on “the third day” (John 2:1)? And why does Jesus call Mary “Woman” (Greek gynē) (John 2:4)? We have no other examples of a Jewish man addressing his own mother this way.
At first glance, John’s reference to “the third day” (John 2:1) might seem to be mere chronological information. However, when read in light of the entire chapter, it appears to be part of a series of allusions to the book of Genesis. Consider, for example, the very first line of John’s Gospel:
The Book of Genesis
The Gospel of John
In the beginning
God created the heavens and the earth…(Genesis 1:1)
In the beginning
was the Word…and the Word was God. (John 1:1)
Just as Genesis begins with the famous account of the seven “days” of creation, the Gospel of John begins with the first seven “days” of Jesus’ public ministry:
The Seven Days of the New Creation
DAY 1	Testimony of John the Baptist (John 1:19)
DAY 2	“The next day” (John 1:29)—the Baptism of Jesus
DAY 3	“The next day” (John 1:35)—Jesus meets Andrew and Peter
DAY 4	“The next day” (John 1:43)—Jesus meets Philip and Nathanael
DAY 7	“The third day” [after Day 4] (John 2:1)—wedding at Cana
Notice here that the way scholars arrive at seven days is by interpreting John’s references sequentially and adding the first four days to the “third day” (4 Days + 3 Days = 7 Days). In light of such parallels, both Protestant and Catholic commentators conclude that the Gospel of John is modeling the first seven days of Jesus’ ministry on the first week of creation in Genesis.23 John is depicting Jesus as a new Adam, whose public ministry is the beginning of “a new creation.”
If this interpretation is correct, it provides a helpful explanation for why Jesus addresses his mother as “Woman” (Greek gynē) (John 2:4). Contrary to what some readers assume, he is not disrespecting Mary. As one Protestant scholar rightly insists: “By no means, however, does the translation of gynē as ‘woman’ imply…rudeness or hostility on the part of Jesus.”24 Instead, the most plausible explanation is that Jesus is addressing Mary as the “woman” of Genesis 3:15. In the words of Raymond Brown, in his influential commentary on the Gospel of John: “John thinks of Mary against the background of Genesis 3…Mary is the New Eve.”25 In support of this interpretation, it’s important to remember that in the book of Genesis, Eve is called “Eve” only once; she is called “woman” eleven times.26 Thus, just as the first Eve invites the first Adam to commit the first sin, so now Mary invites Jesus to perform the first of his “signs.”
This link between Mary and Eve is even stronger in John’s account of Jesus’ crucifixion and death. In order see it clearly, however, we need to keep in mind two points. First, in the Gospel of John, Jesus describes his death on the cross as the hour in which the Devil will be conquered:
“Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the ruler of this world be cast out. And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.” He said this to show by what death he was to die. (John 12:31–33)
Second, at the very the hour when the Devil is finally defeated, Jesus once again addresses his own mother as “Woman”:
But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. (John 19:25–27)
With this final piece of the puzzle in place, the parallels between Eve and Mary in the Gospel of John are complete:
Eve
Mary
1. Called “woman” (11 times)
1. Called “woman” (2 times)
2. Invites Adam to commit the first sin
2. Invites Jesus to perform his first sign
3. With Adam at the Fall; tempted by the Devil to sin
3. With Jesus at the crucifixion
4. Mother of the “offspring” who conquers the “serpent”
4. “Woman” whose “offspring” conquers the Devil
(Genesis 3:1–6, 15)
(John 2:1–12; 19:25–27)
In light of such parallels, there is good reason to conclude that in the Gospel of John, the mother of Jesus is no ordinary woman. In the words of New Testament scholar John Dominic Crossan: “Implicit in the title ‘woman’ is that her full destiny is to be the ‘woman’ of Genesis 3:15.”27
The Book of Revelation: The “Woman,” the Serpent, and the Messiah
But the Gospel of John is not the only New Testament evidence for seeing Mary as foreshadowed in the book of Genesis. Even more explicit is the vision of the “woman clothed with the sun” in the book of Revelation:
And a great portent appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; she was with child and she cried out in her pangs of birth, in anguish for delivery. And another portent appeared in heaven; behold, a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems upon his heads. His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child, that he might devour her child when she brought it forth; she brought forth a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne, and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which to be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days. Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven. And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world—he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him…And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had borne the male child. (Revelation 12:1–9, 13)
Once again, a whole book could be written just on these verses.28 I want to ask only one question: Who is the woman clothed with the sun? Is she an individual? Or does she symbolize a group of people?
On this point, scholars are divided. On the one hand, the woman can be seen as an individual.29 For one thing, she is explicitly identified as the mother of the Messiah: She gives birth to the “male child” who is “to rule all the nations” (Revelation 12:5; compare Psalm 2:7–9). On the other hand, the woman can be interpreted as a collective figure—a symbol for the people of God.30 One reason for seeing her this way is that in the Old Testament, Jerusalem is often depicted as the “bride” of God (Isaiah 62:1–6; Hosea 2:16) and the sufferings of the people to a “woman with child” who “cries out in her pangs” (Isaiah 26:17; Jeremiah 4:31–5:1; Micah 4:10). In fact, the book of Revelation describes the Church as the “Bride” of Christ and as a new “Jerusalem” (Revelation 19:7–8; 21:1–9). For these reasons, many interpreters conclude that the woman in John’s vision is a symbol for Israel, or the Church, or both.
So what should we conclude? Is the woman an individual? Or is she a symbol for the people of God? In this case, the best explanation is not either/or but both/and. There are good reasons to conclude that the “woman clothed with the sun” is both an individual figure and a symbol for the Church. For one thing, scholars are virtually unanimous in recognizing that “the dragon” and the “male child” are primarily individual figures.31 Look at it this way:
Three Individuals in Revelation 12
1. The Serpent =
the Devil
Individual (Satan)
2. The Child =
the Messiah
Individual (Christ)
3. The Woman =
Mother of the Messiah
Individual (Mary)
In other words, if the dragon symbolizes an individual (Satan), and the child symbolizes an individual (Jesus), then it makes sense that the woman also symbolizes an individual (Mary).
With that said, it’s also important to stress that the serpent and the male child in Revelation 12 are not merely individuals. Like the woman, they are apocalyptic symbols for larger groups. For example, the dragon’s “seven heads” and “ten horns” are explicitly identified later on in Revelation as “seven kings” and “ten kings” who persecute the followers of Christ (Revelation 17:7–14).32 In a similar way, the child who is persecuted by the dragon also represents the “followers” of Jesus; that is why a few verses later they are called “the rest” of the woman’s “offspring” (Revelation 12:17).33 Now, if the dragon is an individual (Satan) who also represents a larger group (the wicked kings of the world), and the child is an individual (Jesus) who represents a larger group (the followers of Jesus), then it makes sense to conclude that the woman is also an individual (Mary) who represents a larger group (the Church). In the words of the Protestant biblical scholar Ben Witherington III:
I would suggest…that this figure [the “woman” of Revelation 12] is both the literal mother of the male child Jesus, and also the female image of the people of God.34
In a similar way, the evangelical scholar Scot McKnight asks: “Is it possible that this woman is both Mary and the People of God?”35 To my mind, the answer is a hearty Yes! That is why the most ancient Christian interpretations of Revelation 12 that we possess identify the woman clothed with the sun both with Mary and with the Church.36
In sum, according to the Gospel of John and the book of Revelation, Mary is not just the mother of Jesus. She is also a second Eve and the woman of Genesis 3:15, the mother of the Messiah whose offspring would conquer Satan and undo the Fall of Adam and Eve precisely by dying on the cross.
IMMACULATE MARY
Now that we’ve seen the New Testament parallels between Eve and Mary, we can begin to understand why ancient Christians came to believe that the mother of Jesus not only played a unique role in the history of salvation but also was preserved from all sin. We’ll bring this chapter to a close by briefly looking at the connection between Mary’s identity as the new Eve and the Catholic doctrine of her immaculate conception.37
Ancient Christians Everywhere: Mary Is the New Eve
First and foremost: Although many modern-day Christians are quick to insist that Mary was just an “ordinary woman,” this was certainly not true of ancient Christians. In ancient times, the parallels between Eve and Mary were widely recognized and led to the recognition that just as Eve had played a unique role in the fall of humankind, so Mary plays a unique role in its redemption.38 Consider the following quotations from ancient Christians living in the East and the West:
For Eve…having conceived the word of the serpent, brought forth disobedience and death. But the Virgin Mary received faith and joy. (Justin Martyr, Dialogue with Trypho 100 [2nd century A.D.])39
The knot of Eve’s disobedience was loosed by the obedience of Mary. For what the virgin Eve had bound fast through unbelief, this did the virgin Mary set free through faith. (Irenaeus, Against Heresies 3.22.4 [2nd century A.D.])40
Let women praise her, the pure Mary,—that as in Eve their mother,—great was their reproach,—lo! in Mary their sister,—greatly magnified was their honor. (Ephrem the Syrian, Hymns on the Nativity 15.23 [4th century A.D.])41
Death came through a virgin, Eve. It was necessary that life also should come through a virgin…(Cyril of Jerusalem, Catechetical Lectures 12.15 [4th century A.D.])42
A maiden expelled us from paradise, through a maiden we find eternal life. (John Chrysostom, Commentary on the Psalms 45.4 [4th century A.D.])43
Death came through Eve, but life has come through Mary. (Jerome, Letters 22.21 [4th–5th century A.D.])44
Through woman, poison was poured upon man, in order to deceive him, but salvation was poured out upon man from a woman, that he might be reborn in grace. (Augustine, Sermons 51.3 [4th–5th century A.D.])45
What a remarkable symphony of ancient voices! Note well that these quotations are not from a few marginal writers limited to a particular place or time. They are from Christians writing in Greek, Latin, and Syriac, living in the Holy Land, Africa, Asia Minor, and Europe. For this reason, the famous nineteenth-century expert on the church fathers John Henry Newman once wrote: “The great rudimental teaching of Antiquity from the earliest date” about Mary is that “She is the Second Eve.”46
The Creation of Eve and the Immaculate Conception
Eventually, the understanding of Mary as a second Eve led to the realization that Mary—like Eve herself—was created without sin.47 The logic behind this belief is quite simple: If Mary is really the new Eve, then she must be greater than Eve.
If you think about it for a minute, this makes sense. It is a basic rule of Scripture that Old Testament prefigurations (known as “types”) are never greater than their New Testament fulfillments. In the Bible, Adam prefigures Jesus, but Adam was not greater than Jesus (remember the Fall?). Likewise, David foreshadows Jesus, the true king of Israel. But David was certainly not greater than Christ (remember Bathsheba?). In the same way, if Eve foreshadows Mary, then she cannot be greater than Mary.
As we saw earlier, in the book of Genesis, Eve was created “very good”—that is, she was created without sin (Genesis 1:27–31). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Mary, as the second Eve, must also have been created without sin. In fact, the Eve-Mary typology also suggests that Mary never committed a single sin. For if she had committed even one sin, then the old Eve would be greater than the new Eve. Just as Jesus, the new Adam, was created without sin and lived free from sin, so too Mary, the new Eve, was free from sin. Consider the words of the ancient Christian writers Ephrem the Syrian and Augustine of Hippo:
Only you [Jesus] and your Mother are more beautiful than everything. For on you, O Lord, there is no mark; neither is there any stain in your Mother. (Ephrem, Nisibene Hymns 27.8 [4th century A.D.])48
We must except the holy Virgin Mary, concerning whom I wish to raise no question when it touches the subject of sins, out of honor to the Lord; for from Him we know what abundance of grace for overcoming sin in every particular was conferred upon her who had the merit to conceive and bear Him who undoubtedly had no sin. (Augustine, On Nature and Grace 42 [4th–5th century A.D.])49
Notice here that both Ephrem and Augustine recognize that, apart from Jesus himself, Mary is the only “exception” to the biblical teaching that all human beings after the Fall are born under the power of sin (see Psalm 51:5; Romans 3:23, 5:12–17). Notice also that Augustine is very explicit that Mary’s freedom from sin is not the result of her own efforts. It is not something she earns but is a pure gift of God’s “grace.”
Nevertheless, the question remains: How can ancient Christians say such things about Mary? The New Testament clearly says that Jesus was without sin (Hebrews 4:15). But how can we add Mary to the list? Wouldn’t Mary’s being created without sin mean that she was somehow less than fully human? Not unless Adam and Eve before the Fall are also “less than fully human.”50 Remember: We have to look at Jesus and Mary from an ancient Jewish perspective. And in the Jewish Bible, God does not create Adam and Eve in a state of sin but “very good” (Genesis 1:31). Thus, it makes sense that he would also create the new Adam and Eve without sin:
Old Testament
New Testament
1. Adam: created without sin
1. Jesus: conceived without sin
2. Eve: created without sin
2. Mary: conceived without sin
In sum: If Adam is created without sin, and Eve is created without sin, then why can’t both Jesus and Mary also be conceived without sin? If Jesus really is the new Adam and Mary really is the second Eve, then it is fitting that both of them would be free from sin, without in any way jeopardizing the fullness of their humanity.51
In fact, it is precisely Jesus’ and Mary’s identities as the new Adam and the new Eve that are cited by the official Catechism of the Catholic Church as the biblical foundation for the doctrine that Mary was conceived without sin and that she remained free from sin her whole life. In its discussion of Genesis 3:15 as the “First Gospel” (Latin Protoevangelium), the Catechism says this:
The Christian tradition sees in [Genesis 3:15] an announcement of the “New Adam” who, because he “became obedient unto death, even death on a cross,” makes amends superabundantly for the disobedience of Adam. Furthermore many Fathers and Doctors of the Church have seen the woman announced in the Protoevangelium as Mary, the mother of Christ, the “new Eve.” Mary benefited first of all and uniquely from Christ’s victory over sin: she was preserved from all stain of original sin and by a special grace of God committed no sin of any kind during her whole earthly life. (CCC 411)
Notice here that Mary’s preservation from original sin—known as the “immaculate conception”—has nothing to do with the sinlessness of her parents (as is sometimes wrongly believed). Nor does it have anything to do with Mary being “cleansed so she would not pass on a sinful nature to her son,” as one Protestant scholar recently claimed.52 Instead, according to Catholic teaching, Mary’s freedom from any personal sin is the result of a “special grace” that flows directly from Jesus’ victory over sin. It is not something she earns through her own power. When Pope Pius IX formally defined the dogma of the immaculate conception in 1854, he followed ancient Christian belief in emphasizing that Mary’s preservation from all stain of original sin took place by “a singular grace” of God and “by virtue of the merits of Jesus Christ” (Pius IX, Ineffabilis Deus).53 For this reason, despite her sinlessness—or rather, precisely because she was preserved from all sin—Mary can truly declare that “God” is her “Savior” (Luke 1:47).
Mary: The Beginning of the New Creation
In conclusion, as the new Eve, Mary is the supreme example of what God’s grace can do in a mere human creature. She helps us see clearly that the “good news” of salvation is about undoing the effects of the fall of Adam and Eve and becoming a “new creation” in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17). She helps us to understand that not only did Jesus live without sin on this earth but also, through God’s grace, in the resurrection we too can be completely free from sin. That is why the New Testament itself describes the “spirits” of “just men” who are in heaven as being “made perfect” (Hebrews 12:23). Christ did not die on the cross so that God could pretend that we are righteous. According to Paul, God will truly “make” us “righteous” through the power of his grace (Romans 5:19). As the new Eve, Mary is created without sin to be a “living sign” of the righteous life of the new creation that is ushered in by Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection from the dead. As Jesus himself says in the book of Revelation: “Behold, I make all things new” (Revelation 21:5).54
Of course, Eve is not the only figure in the Jewish Bible that points forward to Mary. Even more enigmatic is the next key to unlocking the mysteries of Jesus’ mother: the lost Ark of the Covenant.
