            <h2>Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary</h2>
            <p>
               chapter 8
AT THE FOOT OF THE CROSS
There is something inescapably sacred about a person’s last words. If you’ve ever had the experience of being with someone you love in his or her last moments, then you know what I’m talking about. Whether the dying person is your mother or father, your sister or brother, your wife or husband, your child or your best friend—if you get the chance to hear them speak, you do not forget the last things they say. Last words reveal the heart of a person: who and what mattered to them in this world, and what they thought most important to say before passing over into the silence of death.
The same thing is true of Jesus’ last words from the cross. They matter too, because they reveal his heart, who and what mattered to him, and what he thought most important to say in the last moments of his earthly life. In this final chapter, I want to bring our journey to a close by focusing on what Jesus said about Mary before he died on the cross. Although we’ve looked at John’s account of Jesus’ death more than once, consider it one last time:
But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home. After this Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfil the scripture), “I thirst.” A bowl full of vinegar stood there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth. When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, “It is finished”; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. (John 19:25–30)
According to the Gospels, Jesus speaks seven times from the cross; but these are the only words that are directly addressed to a follower of his. What are we to make of them? Given the fact that crucifixion was basically death by asphyxiation, why would Jesus willingly suffer the excruciating pain it would have caused him to pull himself up by the nails in his hands and feet and utter these words to his mother and his disciple?1 What does Jesus mean when he says, “behold, your son,” and “behold, your mother”?
JESUS’ LAST WORDS
On the level of the historical meaning of the words, the answer is straightforward but significant.
First, Jesus’ words to Mary and the Beloved Disciple are a kind of formal last will and testament. As biblical scholars have pointed out, in the ancient world, a man sentenced to death by execution was legally able to bequeath his possessions by simply declaring his will from the cross.2 When it comes to Jesus, of course, he has no possessions: no money, no land, and no home to give away. He doesn’t even have any clothes, since the soldiers have already stripped him of his garments and divided them among themselves by casting lots (John 19:23–24). Thus, the only earthly “possession” Jesus has left is his mother. And he even gives her away. As a result, he dies in complete poverty.
Second, Jesus’ last words to Mary and John are a kind of formal act of adoption, by which Mary takes John to be her adopted son, and John takes Mary to be his adoptive mother. In the words of one Protestant scholar:
From the cross, Jesus sees his mother and the Beloved Disciple standing nearby and, with a simple statement, gives the Beloved Disciple as a son to his mother and gives his mother to the Beloved Disciple. By this ceremonial act, a new relationship is formed; a new family is created.3
In ancient Judaism, adoptive relationships were real; they were legally binding. (Think here of the genealogy of Joseph and his adoptive fatherhood toward Jesus.)4 In other words, Jesus is not just expressing a fleeting wish on his part for someone to “look after” Mary once he has died. He is making a formal declaration of his will: Mary really becomes John’s mother and John really becomes Mary’s son.
Third and finally, lest there be any doubt about this, it is important to emphasize the Beloved Disciple’s response: “From that hour the disciple took her to his own home” (John 19:27). On one level, this means that the Beloved Disciple took Mary to live with him—a point that is corroborated by the fact that after the resurrection, when the apostles are gathered together in Jerusalem awaiting Pentecost, “Mary the mother of Jesus” is there with them (Acts 1:14). On the other hand, the original Greek of John’s Gospel does not use the ordinary word for “home” (Greek oikos). What John actually says is that he took Mary “to his own” (Greek eis ta idia) (John 19:27). The Greek word idia is “a broader term that means one’s ‘own,’ ” as in one’s own family, people, or possessions (e.g., John 1:11; Luke 18:28–29).5 In other words, the Beloved Disciple is to treat Mary as his mother. By accepting Jesus’ last will and testament, the mother of Jesus is now John’s own mother and he is now her own son.
In sum, according to the New Testament, the fate of Mary his mother was one of the things that mattered most to Jesus during his last moments on the cross. Only once he has given Mary away to the Beloved Disciple can it be said that “all was now finished” (John 19:28). Only after he has given Mary to John does he lay down his life: “He bowed his head and gave up his spirit” (John 19:30).
HE TOOK HER TO BE HIS OWN
But this is not the only meaning of Jesus’ words. Since ancient times, the Gospel of John has been referred to as the “spiritual Gospel.”6 One reason is that in it there’s almost always a deeper spiritual meaning to Jesus’ words and actions. From this point of view, the last words of Jesus to Mary and John—“Behold, your son…Behold, your mother” (John 19:25, 27)—take on a deeper significance.
For one thing, in the Gospel of John, the Beloved Disciple is an “ideal figure.”7 He is not just a historical follower of Jesus; in a certain sense, he symbolizes what every true “disciple” should aspire to be.8 As Jesus himself says at the Last Supper: “By this my Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit, and so prove to be my disciples. As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love” (John 15:8–9). In other words, every true “disciple” is called to be a “beloved” disciple. Indeed, one plausible reason the author of John’s Gospel does not use the Beloved Disciple’s name is that he wants the reader to see himself or herself in the figure of the disciple “whom Jesus loved” (John 13:23).
If this is correct, then when Jesus speaks his last words to the Beloved Disciple from the cross, in a certain sense, he is also speaking to every disciple. Jesus is saying to each one of his followers: “Behold, your mother.” As one Protestant commentator on the Gospel of John writes:
Mary, the Mother of the Lord, becomes the mother of the faithful, and the Beloved Disciple here seems to denote the ideal Christian convert.9
Notice that this new relationship with Mary is not based on biology or blood; it is created through the passion and death of Jesus. It is the suffering of his “hour” that makes Mary our mother.10 We are the children of the “birth pangs” she experienced at the foot of the cross (cf. John 16:20–21; Revelation 12:1–6). As John says at the beginning of his Gospel: “To all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God; who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God” (John 1:12–13).
Finally, and most important of all, if every disciple is called to imitate the Beloved Disciple, then Jesus is inviting every Christian to take Mary to be his or her own mother. This, at least, is the most ancient interpretation of Jesus’ last words that we possess. In his famous commentary on the Gospel of John, Origen of Alexandria writes:
The firstfruits of the Gospels is that according to John, whose meaning no one can understand who has not leaned on Jesus’ breast nor received Mary from Jesus to be his mother also. (Origen, Commentary on John, 1.23 [3rd century A.D.])11
In other words, Jesus is inviting all of his disciples to enter into a personal relationship with Mary as their own spiritual mother. His dying wish is for Mary to become the mother of all Christians, not just of the Beloved Disciple.
BEHOLD, YOUR MOTHER
But what happens when you do this? What happens when you choose not to ignore or dismiss Mary but to really “behold” her? What happens when you take Jesus’ dying words to heart, imitate the Beloved Disciple, and take Mary to be your own mother?
I’ll tell you what happens: You begin to know Jesus himself better. You begin to see him more clearly. You begin to understand that everything the Bible teaches about Mary is really based on what it teaches about Christ. That, at least, is what Christians have believed since ancient times. And that is what I’ve tried to show over and over again in this book.
When you behold Mary as the new Eve, it does not take anything away from Jesus. Instead, it helps you to see more clearly that he is the new Adam, who comes to triumph over sin and death and usher in the new heavens and new earth.
When you behold Mary as the new Ark, it no more takes away from the glory of Christ than the Ark of the Covenant took away from the glory of God. Instead, you come to realize that Jesus is the new Bread of Life, who came down from heaven and was hidden inside the new Ark. He is also the new Moses, who has come to lead us on a journey that begins in this world and will end in the new promised land of the world to come.
When you behold Mary as the queen mother of the kingdom of God, it does not take away anything from the majesty of Jesus the King. To the contrary, you discover that her queenship and virginal motherhood reveal the deepest of all mysteries: that Jesus is truly Immanuel, “God with us.”
When you behold Mary as the mysterious mother of the Messiah, you begin to grasp the awesome and terrible truth that Jesus brings salvation through suffering and sorrow—not apart from it. And you also begin to realize that these sufferings, however painful, are nothing more than the “birth pangs” of the resurrection from the dead.
When you behold Mary as the new Rachel, mother of the new Joseph, who—against all odds—becomes the savior of the whole world, then you begin to realize that we are beloved younger brothers and sisters. You begin to see that he loves us so much that he even gave us his mother to be our mother—a mother who knows our sufferings and prays for us, just as Rachel did for her children on earth.
Finally, when you begin to behold Mary and take her to be your own mother, you will discover something amazing and precious. You will discover that she is already there, waiting for you. You will discover that Mary was beholding you long before you ever looked at her. You will discover that Mary was praying for you long before you ever began to talk with her. You will find that Mary was loving you long before you ever learned to love her. Because that’s how it is with mothers. When a mother gives birth, she sees her child long before the child can even open its eyes to see her. Perhaps that is one reason why Jesus speaks first to Mary: “ ‘Woman, behold, your son!’ ” (John 19:26). Mary too beholds the Beloved Disciple before he beholds her.
The same thing is true today. Mary, like Jesus himself, is not dead. She is very much alive in the heavenly kingdom. She already tastes the glory of the resurrection and the new creation. And she is beholding you; she is praying for you; she is loving you. Right now, she is waiting to see if you too will respond to Jesus’ last words and take her to be your own: “Behold, your mother.”
