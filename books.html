               CHAPTER 5
The Canon of Scripture Considered
The fact that many churches avoid uncomfortable topics, not only in the preaching of the Word but in Bible study as well, leads to the creation of blind spots in the theology of even the most devout Christians. These blind spots can then function as a door through which false teaching is introduced; hence the importance of doing as Paul said, preaching the “whole counsel of God” (Acts 20:27 ESV).
One such topic that makes many a Christian uncomfortable is the canon of Scripture. Why are there only so many books in the Bible? Could there be more? Less? What if new books were found? Who decided? On what basis? When? Can we really know?
The questions pile upon each other, and because most related resources stick to answering historical questions rather than delving into theological issues and ramifications, many believers have found themselves unprepared to deal with an attack upon scriptural sufficiency in a discussion of canon matters. To illustrate this, I begin with a “reversed” dialogue that, sadly, has frequently taken place with disastrous results. I include it only to impress upon us all the gravity of the subject to which we now turn. Since this approach is a Roman Catholic favorite, we’ll consider a conversation between Gerry, a Catholic apologist, and Andy, a Protestant.
ANDY: Yes, I believe in sola scriptura. I believe the Bible is sufficient to give me the guidance I need to know God truly.
GERRY: But sola scriptura is a human invention, a tradition itself. Nowhere does the Bible teach it; in fact, the Bible contradicts it.
ANDY: The Bible contradicts sola scriptura?
GERRY: It certainly does. Not only does the Bible teach the necessity of sacred tradition, but the most glaring contradiction of sola scriptura deals with the canon itself. If you hold to sola scriptura, you simply cannot give any meaningful explanation of how the canon came to be.
ANDY: What do you mean? The canon of Scripture doesn’t impact the sufficiency of Scripture.
GERRY: How could it not, Andy? How can you believe the Scriptures are sufficient as the sole rule of faith for the church if you don’t even know what the Scriptures are? If the Scriptures depend upon an outside source[1] for their very existence, or at least for our knowledge of them, then how can they all of a sudden become sufficient once that outside source finally defines them? If they were dependent at one point in time,[2] why does that position of dependency change later on?[3]
ANDY: God inspired the Scriptures, Gerry. There was no outside source that made the Scriptures any more inspired.
GERRY: Of course not, but that isn’t the issue, is it? How do you know, for example, that the gospel of Matthew is inspired but that the gospel of Thomas is not? How do you know Esther really belongs in the canon? Why do you reject Maccabees, when it was viewed as Scripture by early Christians? Are you certain that Mark wrote the gospel of Mark? Does Revelation really belong?
ANDY: Well, there were various means the early church used…
GERRY: The early what?
ANDY: The early church—
GERRY: I thought that’s what you said. So the church canonized Scripture?
ANDY: Well, yes, in a fashion. It wasn’t like they created the canon, but they followed certain guidelines…
GERRY: Rules, perhaps?
ANDY: Well, yes—
GERRY: And where did they get these rules?
ANDY: It was just a means of making sure the writings that were accepted were genuine, related to an apostle of Christ—
GERRY: That’s fine, but who says those issues determine the canon of Scripture? For instance, who made apostolic connection a test for canonicity? And what if the early church messed up? What then?
ANDY: I don’t believe any errors were made…well, except when Rome added the apocryphal books.[4]
GERRY: You mean when Luther deleted them? We’ll discuss that later, but you do admit that someone could mess up—in fact, in your opinion, someone did mess up regarding the deuterocanonicals, correct?[5] How do you know that didn’t also happen in the third century or fourth century?[6] And if it did, what good is your sola scriptura?
See, Andy, without an infallible magisterium to give you an infallible Bible, you simply don’t have the certitude you think you have. By rejecting the living voice of the church, the “pillar and support of the truth,”[7] in reality you have bitten the hand that feeds you. You reject the very means God has used to give you the canon in an attempt to exalt those writings beyond the intention of God Himself!
ANDY: But Gerry, God never intended the church to be above the Scriptures.
GERRY: I never said the church is above the Scriptures. The Scriptures are part of the church’s tradition, the written component. Once you overemphasize one aspect of tradition, the proper balance is lost, and this is what you have done. Teaching sola scriptura takes Scripture out of its correct relationship to the church; as a result, you can no longer explain how you even know what the Scriptures contain, let alone logically defend the idea of their supremacy in all things. Your position is left hanging in midair, indefensible. You must account for the canon, Andy, to even begin to defend sola scriptura. If the canon is a revelation from God, does it not of necessity exist outside of Scripture? How then can sola scriptura—Scripture alone—be true?
How would you respond to Gerry’s arguments? For many, the issue of the canon is the Achilles heel of scriptural sufficiency; however, in reality, the above dialogue contains numerous faulty presuppositions and assumptions that must be challenged if a meaningful conversation about the canon is to take place. Unfortunately, those presuppositions and assumptions are almost never challenged, which forces the defender of scriptural sufficiency to defend concepts and ideas that are not only unnecessary but also contradictory to the truth of the position he holds. Before illustrating this in dialogue format, we need to consider the canon from a theological perspective.
THE CANON CONSIDERED
When we look to most of the modern, conservative discussions of the canon,[8] we learn much about the external aspects of the “canon process,” like the historical considerations that can be discerned when we examine the writings of the early church or collate evidence from ancient manuscripts. We learn about the importance that apostolic authority had to the early church in discerning between the genuine and the spurious, and how the text needed to speak authoritatively. We see clear evidence of the creation of collections of books, especially regarding the Gospels and Pauline epistles. We likewise see controversy regarding such books as Hebrews, 2 Peter, and Revelation. We learn that canonization, at least as experienced by the church in time, is a process, especially given that the New Testament books were not written and “published” at the same time or in the same place. Thus, some books were more known and more popular in particular geographical areas, becoming familiar to other sections of the church as years passed. Such would be expected given the culture and technology of the day and the speed at which communication took place. Books written in a particular area (or originally sent there) would have greater exposure than those unfamiliar to the local believers.
Going even further back we find a broad scope of unanimity regarding the Old Testament, especially among the writings of the Jews themselves.[9] As we will note in dialogue, the majority of Jewish writers did not embrace the apocryphal books, and the case against their canonicity is broad and weighty. Even so, there were also discussions concerning Esther, for example (which never uses the name of God), and the Song of Solomon.
History reveals to us that there was a process involved in the formation of the canon. No one claimed, at least at that time, that God had sent down a Golden Index from heaven so that there would be no need for discussion or discernment. Nor did anyone dream that an individual or an immediate circle of believers had the authority to canonize the Scriptures. It was recognized that God had to inspire a writing before it could be canonical. The nature of Scripture as revelation from God was recognized as the foundation of the concept of “canon.”
History, though, can only reveal the outworkings of something divine in nature and intention. Historical inquiry can tell us, fragmentarily, what took place in particular areas, but it cannot make known why things happened as they did. For this, we must consider the only source that can tell us about Scripture’s purpose and intention: Scripture itself.
What is the canon? The term itself does not specifically appear in the Bible, and we cannot come to Scripture and get a direct response to the question, “What is the canon, where does it come from, what is its relationship to Scripture, and how do we know it?” (at least not in the way we might seek such answers from an encyclopedia or an online manual). Thankfully, however, the Scriptures answer those questions in a deeper, more satisfying fashion. We simply need to frame our inquiries appropriately.
WHAT IS THE CANON?
The term canon originally referred to a stick by which a measurement was made. By extension it came to mean a rule or standard, and finally it was applied to an authoritative list of something, such as all the books written by a certain author or, in this case, the books of Scripture. However, if we think the biblical canon is nothing more than a fancy way of referring to the table of contents, we have missed the heart of the issue and will never arrive at a satisfactory answer to our questions.
I have become firmly convinced over years of study—including study of positive presentations by great theologians of the past and negative attacks upon biblical sufficiency from many different angles—that most discussions or debates over the canon start off on the wrong foot. A shallow, one-sided concept of the canon is usually allowed to determine the dialogue’s outcome. If the canon is nothing more than the table of contents, then it is a purely human thing, known by men and hence subject to all the endless debates and arguments history presents as having already taken place in almost every generation. But what if the canon is more than that?
We need to start off by realizing we are talking about the canon of Scripture. As we have already seen, Scripture is theopneustos, God-breathed; to say we are talking about something unique is to master the art of understatement. Scripture does not simply drop down out of heaven like rain to be gathered up and organized by man. The nature of Scripture determines the canon of Scripture; that is, the canon must be defined in light of what Scripture is. If Scripture is (1) God-breathed and (2) given for the purposes revealed within its own revelation, then vitally important conclusions must be drawn from these two truths, conclusions that deeply impact our understanding of the canon and its function.
The reason I raise these issues is simple: I believe we must determine the divine view and purpose of the canon before we can have any basis upon which to discuss the human side of recognizing and understanding the canon. This may seem like a simplistic thought, but it seems often to have been left out in consideration of this subject: Without the act of inspiration (revelation), there would be no canon. So why think the canon of Scripture is to be determined and analyzed in the same way as the canon of the writings of, say, Plato, or Pliny the Younger? There are parallels, as we will see, but the fact that we are dealing with a book God intends to exist in a particular form for a particular purpose cannot be ignored.
The thesis I will seek to establish is this: The canon is an artifact of revelation, not an object of revelation itself. It is known infallibly to God by necessity and to man with a certainty directly related to God’s purpose in giving the Word to the church. The canon exists because God has inspired some writings, not all writings. It is known to man in fulfillment of God’s purpose in engaging in the action of inspiration so as to give to His people a lamp for their feet and a light for their path. The canon, then, has two aspects as we consider it in light of its relationship to God’s overall purpose in giving the Scriptures. The first aspect, to which I will refer as canon1, is the divine knowledge and understanding of the canon. The second aspect, which I will identify as canon2, is the human knowledge and understanding of the canon (which has been the primary focus of debate down through the centuries). Hopefully, through this differentiation, we will be able to see through the fallacious arguments that far too often cloud the subject of the canon of Scripture.
THE CANON AS AN ARTIFACT OF REVELATION
Why does the canon exist? Perhaps this may seem far too obvious a question to even ask, but, having asked it, how many have ever considered it? Does the canon need to exist? Yes, it does, of necessity. Why? The answer helps us to understand one of the most common misconceptions concerning the canon.
When an author writes a book, a “canon” of his or her writings is automatically created as a result of the simple consideration that he or she has written at least one book, but has not written all books that have ever been written. Hence, a canon of a single book comes into existence at the completion of that first work. If the author continues writing, the canon changes with the completion of each project. It should be noted that even if the author does not write down a listing of his or her works, a canon exists nonetheless, which he or she knows infallibly. No one else can infallibly know this canon outside of the author’s effort to communicate it to others, for only the author knows what he or she has truly written. Even those closest to the author may not know with utter certainty whether the author has used anyone else in the writing process or whether he or she has borrowed from someone else. Therefore, the originator of a book (or books) has an infallible knowledge of the canon of those works, while anyone else has a mediated knowledge, dependent upon both the honesty and integrity of the author and the author’s desire to make that canon known to others.
When we apply these considerations to Scripture, we are able to see that canon1 is the necessary result of God’s freely chosen act of inspiration.[10] Once God’s Spirit moved upon the very first author of Scripture, canon1 came into existence. Before anyone else could possibly know what God had done (canon2),[11] God infallibly knew the current state and content of canon1. With each passing phase of His unfolding revelation in Scripture, canon1 remained current and infallible, fully reflective (by necessity) of the ongoing work of enscripturation. This is why we should call the canon an artifact of revelation: It is not itself an object of revelation, but comes into existence as a by-product of the action itself. God inspires, and the canon expresses the limitation of that action.
Note something else as well: Canon1 exists whether or not canon2 exists. Canon1 is necessary, while canon2 is based solely upon God’s desire to make known the extent of His act of revelation. Theoretically, God could keep canon1 to Himself, leaving the world in utter darkness concerning what is and is not inspired. And even as God leads His people to gain knowledge of canon2, there can be times when the certain knowledge of canon2 lags behind the actual content of canon1. The knowledge of canon2 is dependent upon God’s purposes at any given point in time, and if His intentions include using a human process in the creation of canon2, that process may not result in a clear and widely known canon listing for some time after the giving of that revelation.
The nature of canon2 in regard to inspiration is vital to properly understanding the historic canon process. Once we realize that it is Scripture, not man’s knowledge of the canon, that is inspired, and that canon1 exists perfectly in God’s mind, we can see that the clarity and knowledge of canon2 is dependent not upon human beings, councils, churches, or anything else in this world, but instead upon God’s purposes in giving us the inspired Scriptures in the first place. Is a clear knowledge of the canon’s extent important to the function of Scripture in the church? Yes. So does it not follow that God will both providentially preserve the Scriptures and lead His people to a functional, sufficient knowledge of the canon so as to fulfill His purpose in inspiring them? Indeed, will He not exercise just as much divine power in establishing and fulfilling His purpose for the Scriptures (their functioning as a guide to the church) as He has in inspiring them? These two actions are necessarily linked in fulfilling the one purpose of God.
As this issue forms a major portion of our understanding of the canon, we must provide a biblical foundation for the idea that God has a purpose in giving the Scriptures to the church and that He is intent on fulfilling that purpose.
GOD’S PROMISES REGARDING SCRIPTURE AND THE CHURCH
We have already examined Paul’s teaching on the nature of Scripture and noted its testimony to Scripture’s ability to equip us:
All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work. (2 Timothy 3:16–17 ESV)
God breathed out Scripture for many reasons, but the one included here is so that the man of God may be “competent” (or “thoroughly equipped”) for every good work; specifically, so that he may teach, reprove, correct, and train—all “good works” of ministry within the body. In God’s providence, the very form of the church, having elders in the position of teaching and admonishing and leading, requires it to have access to this God-breathed source of authority, the Scriptures. Therefore, the divine impetus to preserve and make known the Scriptures is equal to the divine impetus in forming and building the church itself—what good would it be to build a ship without a rudder? The Scriptures provide the direction, the guiding light, to the godly leaders of God’s people in the body of Christ. Providing clear information relating to canon2 is part of the fulfillment of God’s purpose for the very structure of the church.
Long ago the prophet Isaiah spoke about God’s redemption of Israel. Surely there was a direct fulfillment of these words in his day, but it is clear in reading chapter 55 that the prophetic voice soars far beyond the immediate context of Isaiah’s ministry. Listen to his words:
For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
So are My ways higher than your ways
And My thoughts than your thoughts.
For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven,
And do not return there without watering the earth
And making it bear and sprout,
And furnishing seed to the sower and bread to the eater;
So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;
It will not return to Me empty,
Without accomplishing what I desire,
And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.
(vv. 9–11)
The promise of the effectual ministry of God’s Word has, as its immediate application, reference to the prophetic word He gave through Isaiah concerning the deliverance of Israel. But the entire passage goes far beyond this context: The assurance Israel has of God’s favor is based upon overarching themes, such as God’s transcendence over creation and the absolute certainty of His Word. What is true of His “Word” as prophecy is likewise true of His “Word” in the wider category of Scripture. The Lord Jesus may well have been reflecting this general theme of Scripture’s infallible power in fulfilling God’s purpose and intention when He said to the
