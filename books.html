            <h2>Jesus and the Jewish Roots of Mary</h2>
            <p>
               chapter 3
THE NEW ARK
My first encounter with the Ark of the Covenant was through the blockbuster movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. Since I was too young to see the film when it was first released, I got a Read-Along Book and Record version for Christmas. I still vividly remember one of its pictures: Professor Indiana Jones holding open a dusty old Bible and pointing to a drawing of the Israelites conquering their enemies by means of the sacred chest and its “mysterious powers.” According to Professor Jones, any army who carried the Ark into battle was undefeatable.
Looking back now, I can’t help but wonder what impact that book had on my later fascination with the Bible and archaeology (and my decision to become a professor). In any case, I was much older when I learned that the premise for the film—the “lost” Ark of the Covenant—is actually deeply rooted in Jewish Scripture and tradition. Although there was a thriving Temple in Jerusalem at the time of Jesus, from a Jewish point of view, this Temple was missing something essential. The Holy of Holies, which was supposed to house the Ark of the Covenant, was empty. Nevertheless, as we will see momentarily, there was a Jewish tradition that the location of the lost Ark would one day be revealed.
One reason this ancient Jewish hope for the return of the Ark is important is that, according to the New Testament, Jesus is not just the new Adam. He is also the new Moses, who has come to inaugurate a new exodus. Over and over again, Jesus does and says things strikingly similar to what Moses did and said. Just as Moses fasted for forty days and forty nights on Mount Sinai (Exodus 34:28), so Jesus fasts for forty days and forty nights in the desert (Luke 4:1–2). Just as Moses fed the Israelites in the desert with miraculous bread from heaven (Exodus 16:1–31), so Jesus feeds the multitudes in the wilderness with miraculous bread (Luke 9:10–17). And just as Moses established the “covenant” with the twelve tribes of Israel (Exodus 24:1–8), so Jesus establishes a “new covenant” with the twelve apostles at the Last Supper (Luke 22:20).
On the other hand, the exodus inaugurated by Jesus is also strikingly different from the exodus from Egypt at the time of Moses. Perhaps the most significant difference has to do with where the new exodus begins and ends. The word “exodus” means “journey.” With every journey, there must be a point of departure and a destination. For Moses, the exodus begins in the land of Egypt and ends in the promised land. According to the Gospel of Luke, however, the exodus of Jesus is different:
And behold, two men talked with [Jesus], Moses and Elijah, who appeared in glory and spoke of his departure (Greek exodos), which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem. (Luke 9:30–31)
Then [after the resurrection]…lifting up his hands he blessed them. While he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven. (Luke 24:50–51)
For Luke, the new exodus begins in Jerusalem and ends in heaven. In contrast to the journey of Moses, for Jesus the earthly promised land is just the point of departure—not the ultimate destination.
The reason all of this matters for us is this: If Jesus is the new Moses, then where is the new Ark? As any first-century Jew would have known, during the time of the first exodus, the Ark of the Covenant played a central role. Thus, if the Messiah was to be a new Moses who inaugurated a new exodus, then it would make sense for him to bring back the lost Ark of the Covenant. How can you have a new exodus without a new Ark?
In this chapter, we will explore how the New Testament reveals that Mary is the new Ark of the new exodus. As we will see, Mary’s identity as the new Ark has direct implications for ancient Christian beliefs about the divinity of Jesus as well as the bodily assumption of Mary into heaven at the end of her life. In order to see all this clearly, however, we have to go back and do a bit of digging into what happened to the original Ark.
THE LOST ARK OF THE COVENANT
In order to get a firm grasp on ancient Jewish beliefs about the return of the lost Ark, we need to start with the Hebrew Bible.1 Then, once we’ve clarified the biblical accounts of the Ark, we can take a few moments to explore what later Jewish writings have to say.
The Ark of the Covenant: Dwelling Place of God on Earth
The first time the Ark of the Covenant is mentioned in Jewish Scripture is in the book of Exodus, in the midst of the story of Israel’s departure from Egypt and their forty-year journey through the desert. After the people of Israel arrive at Mount Sinai and receive the Ten Commandments (Exodus 19–20), God does something extremely significant. He gives the Israelites instructions for how to build a sanctuary for him to dwell in—a kind of portable temple, known as the “Tabernacle” (Exodus 25:8–9).
The very first piece of sacred furniture that God commands to be built and placed in the Tabernacle is the Ark of the Covenant. Although it is detailed, the initial description of the Ark is worth reading carefully:
And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst. According to all that I show you concerning the pattern of the tabernacle, and of all its furniture, so you shall make it. They shall make an ark of acacia wood…And you shall overlay it with pure gold, within and without shall you overlay it…You shall make poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. And you shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark, to carry the ark by them…And you shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you. Then you shall make a mercy seat of pure gold…And you shall make two cherubim of gold; of hammered work shall you make them, on the two ends of the mercy seat…The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings, their faces one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be. And you shall put the mercy seat on the top of the ark; and in the ark you shall put the testimony that I shall give you. There I will meet with you, and from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim that are upon the ark of the testimony, I will speak with you of all that I will give you in commandment for the people of Israel. (Exodus 25:8–14, 16–18, 20–22)
For our purposes here, several features of the Ark are important to highlight.2
First and foremost, the Tabernacle where the Ark is kept is the dwelling place of God on earth. That’s the reason the “sanctuary” is built: to be the place where God will “dwell” in the “midst” of his people (Exodus 25:8).3 Inside the Tabernacle, the Ark will be where God will “meet with” his people and “speak” to them (Exodus 25:22).
Second, the Ark is a sacred chest containing the Ten Commandments. That is what God means when he says: “You shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you” (Exodus 25:16). The Hebrew word for “ark” (Hebrew ’aron) simply means “box” or “chest,” and the word “testimony” is another way of referring to the tablets of the Ten Commandments (Exodus 31:18). Eventually, in addition to the two tablets, a golden bowl of manna and the miraculous staff of the high priest Aaron that “budded” would also be kept inside the Ark (see Exodus 16:34; Numbers 17:10).4
Third, the Ark is made of incorruptible wood. God is very specific that the Ark shall be made of “acacia wood” (Hebrew shittim). As Old Testament scholars point out, acacia wood was regarded as holy in ancient Egypt; it is also extremely durable.5 In fact, the Jewish Septuagint translates “acacia” as “incorruptible wood” (Exodus 25:5 LXX).6 Likewise, the first-century Jewish historian Josephus wrote that the Ark was made “of wood that was naturally strong, and could not be corrupted” (Josephus, Antiquities 3.134).7
Fourth, the Ark is covered in pure gold. In the Jewish Bible, the word “pure” (Hebrew tahor) is used to refer to gold that is “clean”—that is, free from any impurities.8 In context, the purity of the gold used seems to symbolize the absolute holiness of the Ark.9 That is why it can be carried only using the golden poles; the Ark is too holy for sinful human beings even to touch it. For readers who might assume that all statues are unbiblical, it is important to point out here that God himself commands the Israelites to make two golden statues of “cherubim”—that is, angels—and place them on top of the Ark (Exodus 25:17–18). It is also worth noting that the holiness of the Ark is also clear from the fact that elsewhere in Scripture the Israelites are commanded to “cover the ark” by veiling it with “a cloth of blue,” whenever they have to carry it (Numbers 4:5–6).
Finally, the Ark and the Tabernacle together are the place where the glory “cloud” will descend from heaven.10 When Moses and the Israelites finally finish building the Tabernacle and put the Ark inside, this is what happens:
[Moses] brought the ark into the tabernacle…So Moses finished the work. Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting, because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. Throughout all their journeys, whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the people of Israel would go onward; but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not go onward till the day that it was taken up. (Exodus 40:21, 33–38)
It is difficult to overestimate the significance of the descent of the cloud of God’s “glory” (Hebrew kabod) upon the Tabernacle. The glory cloud was not just a visible sign that God had come down to earth to be with his people. It was also the means by which God would lead his people through the wilderness to bring them home to the promised land. As a rule, if the Israelites fought their enemies with the Ark in their midst, they were victorious (Joshua 6:1–21), but if the Ark was absent, they were defeated (Numbers 14:44–45; compare, however, 1 Samuel 4).
The Ark Goes Up to Jerusalem
For many people, the familiar tale of the Ark stops with the book of Exodus. But according to the Bible, there is much more to be said.
To make a long story very short: Once the Israelites arrive in the promised land of Canaan, the Ark of the Covenant moves around quite a bit.11 During the time of Joshua and the Judges of Israel (traditionally dated between 1450 and 1020 B.C.), the Ark is kept at various local sanctuaries in the promised land, such as Gilgal, Shiloh, and Bethel (see Joshua 4:19, 7:6, 18:1; Judges 20:26–28). At one point, the Ark is actually captured by the Philistines, until they are stricken by God with a plague of “tumors”—which the New American Bible translates as a plague of “hemorrhoids” (1 Samuel 5:1–12)! In the face of this kind of suffering, it’s understandable that the Philistines quickly return the Ark to the Israelites (1 Samuel 6:1–7:3).
Eventually, sometime around 1000 B.C., King David decides to bring the Ark from Baale-judah to the city of Jerusalem and give it a permanent home. According to the second book of Samuel, David “arose and went” with the people of Israel “to bring up…the ark of God” (2 Samuel 6:1–2). Tragically, instead of carrying the Ark with the golden poles (as the Law of Moses instructed), they placed the Ark upon a cart of oxen—a plan which proves fatal for a man named Uzzah:
And when they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there because he put forth his hand to the ark; and he died there beside the ark of God. And David was angry because the LORD had broken forth upon Uzzah…And David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said, “How can the ark of the LORD come to me?” So David was not willing to take the ark of the LORD into the city of David; but David took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. And the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months; and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household. (2 Samuel 6:6–11)
Once David discovers that Obed-edom and his family are actually blessed “because of the ark of God,” he resumes bringing the Ark up to Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6:12). This time, they do it the right way, carrying the Ark by its poles and offering sacrifices of thanksgiving to God: “So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing…And David danced before the LORD with all his might…So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the LORD with shouting, and with the sound of the horn” (2 Samuel 6:12, 14–15).
Although for many people today, the bringing of the Ark to Jerusalem by King David is not one of the most familiar passages in the Bible, the same was not true for ancient Jews. For them, the ascent of King David and the Ark to the mountain of Jerusalem was nothing less than the coming of God himself.12 The event is memorialized in one of the Psalms “of Ascents” that Jewish pilgrims would sing while “going up” to Jerusalem:13
Remember, O LORD, in David’s favor, all the hardships he endured;
how he swore to the LORD and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob,
“I will not enter my house or get into my bed;
I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,
until I find a place for the LORD,
a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob…”
Arise, O LORD, and go to your resting place,
you and the ark of your might.
Let your priests be clothed with righteousness,
and let your saints shout for joy…
For the LORD has chosen Zion; he has desired it for his habitation:
“This is my resting place for ever; here I will dwell.”
(Psalm 132:1–5, 8–9, 13–14)14
Notice here that for the Psalmist, where the Ark goes, the presence of “the LORD” goes. Why? Because of the glory cloud. Likewise, when we turn to the biblical account of King Solomon finishing the building of the Jerusalem Temple, we discover that it is only after the priests bring the Ark of the Covenant into the Holy of Holies that the “cloud” from heaven once again comes down and fills the Temple (1 Kings 8:10–11). Now that the Ark is where it belongs, God can once again dwell with his people.15
Unfortunately, after the death of Solomon, the whole thing fell apart. Not only did the kingdom of Israel eventually split in two (see 1 Kings 11–12), but eventually, the Temple itself and the city of Jerusalem were destroyed. According to the prophet Ezekiel, before the Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians (in 587 B.C.), the “glory” cloud of God’s presence departed from Jerusalem (Ezekiel 10).
What Happened to the Lost Ark of the Covenant?
So what actually happened to the Ark of the Covenant? How was it lost?
As anyone who has watched one of the many television documentaries about the “mysteries of the Bible” knows, theories about the location of the lost Ark abound.16 Some assume that the Ark was stolen by the Babylonians when they destroyed the Temple. However, the Hebrew Scriptures themselves do not list the Ark among the sacred objects that were taken by Babylon (see 2 Kings 25:13–17; Jeremiah 52:17–23). Others speculate that the Ark is hidden is some unknown location, just waiting to be discovered by some lucky archaeologist (like Indiana Jones). One popular theory holds that the Ark is currently hidden in Ethiopia in a sanctuary that can be entered only by the monks who guard it, thus making it impossible for outsiders to verify or falsify the claim.
The odd thing about all of these theories is that they ignore the oldest evidence we possess regarding the disappearance of the Ark. I am referring to the ancient Jewish tradition that the prophet Jeremiah took the Ark from Jerusalem and hid it in Mount Nebo, in the territory east of the Jordan River, shortly before the Temple was destroyed. This important tradition is preserved in 2 Maccabees, usually dated to the mid-second century B.C.:
It was also in the writing that the prophet [Jeremiah], having received an oracle, ordered that the tent and the ark should follow with him, and that he went out to the mountain where Moses had gone up and had seen the inheritance of God. And Jeremiah came and found a cave, and he brought there the tent and the ark and the altar of incense, and he sealed up the entrance. Some of those who followed him came up to mark the way, but could not find it. When Jeremiah learned of it, he rebuked them and declared: “The place shall be unknown until God gathers his people together again and shows his mercy. And then the Lord will disclose these things, and the glory of the Lord and the cloud will appear, as they were shown in the case of Moses, and as Solomon asked that the place should be specially consecrated.” (2 Maccabees 2:4–8)
Although this fascinating tradition is well known to scholars, it is not familiar to many Bible readers, because it is found only in the Catholic Old Testament. According to 2 Maccabees, there is no mystery about the fate of the Ark. We know exactly what happened to it. Jeremiah the prophet, who was also a priest in the Jerusalem Temple, hid the Ark in a cave on Mount Nebo—the same mountain where Moses had been allowed by God to go up and see the promised land before he died (Deuteronomy 34:1–4).17 On the other hand, the text also reflects the ancient Jewish belief that one day, the lost Ark will reappear. When will the Ark be found? According to Jeremiah, its location shall remain “unknown” until God “shows his mercy” and brings back the glory “cloud” (2 Maccabees 2:8). In other words, you will know where the Ark is when you see it overshadowed by the cloud of “the glory of the Lord.”
One reason this tradition is so significant is that at the time of Jesus, the Jewish people were still waiting for the return of the lost Ark. Although modern-day readers are often unaware, first-century Jews knew full well that the current Jerusalem Temple was lacking two crucially important features. First, it was missing the glory cloud, which had departed from the Temple shortly before it was destroyed by Babylon (see Ezekiel 10:18–22, 11:22–23). Second, and equally devastating, it was missing the Ark. In the words of the first-century Jewish historian Josephus:
But the inmost part of the temple…was also separated from the outer part by a veil. In this there was nothing at all. It was inaccessible and inviolable, and not to be seen by any; and was called the Holy of Holies. (Josephus, War 5.219)18
Remarkably, Josephus’s words find confirmation in the Greco-Roman histories of Tacitus, who tells us that when the Roman general Pompey conquered Jerusalem in the first century B.C., he actually went inside the Jerusalem Temple but found that “the place was empty and the secret shrine contained nothing” (Tacitus, Histories 5.9).19
In short, at the time of Jesus, any Jew familiar with Scripture and tradition would have known that the Jewish people were not only waiting for a new Moses to come and deliver them. They were also waiting for the revelation of the location of the Ark and the return of the glory cloud of God’s presence. With these two hopes in mind, we can now turn to what the New Testament reveals about the location of the lost Ark and the revelation of God’s glory.
MARY THE NEW ARK
When we turn to the pages of the New Testament and read them through ancient Jewish eyes, conscious of the importance of a new exodus and the Ark of the Covenant, we discover that Mary, the mother of Jesus, is linked with the glory cloud and the Ark itself. We find this in the Gospel of Luke and the book of Revelation. Let’s take a few moments to examine the evidence.
The Annunciation: The Return of the Glory Cloud
The first key passage for connecting Mary with the Ark of the Covenant is the famous account of the annunciation: The angel Gabriel appears to the virgin Mary and announces that she will miraculously conceive and give birth to Jesus (Luke 1:26–38). For most readers, the main point of this account is that Gabriel is announcing the conception of the “Son of the Most High” (Luke 1:32). And this is certainly right.
However, from a first-century Jewish perspective, the annunciation is not just the story of the conception of “the Son of God” (Luke 1:35). It is also the story of the return of the long-absent “cloud” of God’s “glory.” You can see this if you look carefully at Gabriel’s words to Mary. After the angel announces that she will conceive and bear a son, Mary responds by asking: “How shall this be, since I do not know man?” (Luke 1:34). We’ll come back to the meaning of these words in Chapter 5. For now, what matters is Gabriel’s response to Mary’s question:
And the angel said to her,
“The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
and the power of the Most High will overshadow you;
therefore the child to be born will be called holy,
the Son of God. (Luke 1:35)
There it is. Did you catch the image of the “glory cloud” from the Old Testament? Although it’s easy to miss in the English translation, when you compare the original Greek of Luke’s account with the ancient Jewish translation known as the Septuagint (commonly referred to as the “LXX”), you’ll discover an important parallel between the descent of the glory cloud upon the Tabernacle and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Mary:
The Tabernacle
The Virgin Mary
The cloud of the Lordʼs glory “overshadows” (episkiaz) the Tabernacle. (Exodus 40:35–35 LXX)
The Holy Spirit “overshadows” (episkiaz) the Virgin Mary. (Luke 1:35)
In light of the distinctive use of the word “overshadow” (Greek episkiazō) in the Greek Bible, many scholars from a variety of perspectives—Jewish, Protestant, and Catholic—have concluded that the imagery of the Holy Spirit overshadowing Mary is meant to call to mind the “glory cloud” of the exodus.20 As one Protestant scholar writes:
Mary’s experience is to be compared with the dramatic way in which God’s glory and the cloud marking his presence came down upon the completed tabernacle.21
In other words, just as the Ark in the Tabernacle was the special place of God’s presence in the exodus from Egypt, so now, through the annunciation Mary has become the special dwelling place of God’s glory in the new exodus.
The Visitation to Elizabeth: The New Ark Revealed
Significantly, these allusions to the Tabernacle and the Ark do not stop with Luke’s account of the annunciation. Several more striking parallels between Mary and the Ark are present in Luke’s account of Mary’s visitation to her cousin Elizabeth (Luke 1:39–56). For most readers, the main point of the visitation is to tell how John the Baptist “leaped for joy” in his mother’s womb (Luke 1:44). However, when we reread the account of the visitation in light of what the Jewish Scriptures say about the Ark of the Covenant, we discover that something more is going on:
In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a city of Judah, and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and she exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the voice of your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.” And Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden. For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed; for he who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is his name…He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy, as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his posterity for ever.” And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her home. (Luke 1:39–49, 54–56)
When Luke’s account of Mary’s visit to Elizabeth is read in light of the Old Testament story of David bringing the Ark up to Jerusalem, several striking parallels emerge:
The Ark of the Covenant
The Virgin Mary
The glory of the Lord and the cloud cover the Tabernacle (containing the Ark) and “overshadow” (episkiaz) them. (Exodus 40:34–35, cf. v. 3)
The Holy Spirit comes upon Mary and the power of the Most High “overshadows” (episkiaz) her. (Luke 1:35)
David “arose and went” to the hill country of Judah to bring up “the ark of God”. (2 Samuel 6:2)
Mary “arose and went” into the hill country of Judah to visit Elizabeth. (Luke 1:39)
David admits his unworthiness to receive the Ark by exclaiming: “How can the ark of the LORD come to me?” (2 Samuel 6:9)
Elizabeth admits her unworthiness to receive Mary by exclaiming: “And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?” (Luke 1:43)
David “leaped” before the Ark as it was brought in “with shouting.” (2 Samuel 6:15–16)
John “leaped” in Elizabeths womb at the sound of Marys voice and Elizabeth cried “with a loud shout.” (Luke 1:41–42)
The Ark remained in the hill country, in the house of Obed-Edom, “three months.” (2 Samuel 6:11)
Mary remained in the hill country, in Elizabeths house, “three months.” (Luke 1:56)
How do we explain these parallels between Mary and the Ark? Are they just coincidences?
Unfortunately, many books and commentaries simply ignore the parallels between Mary and the Ark, as if they do not exist.22 Others acknowledge that the parallels are present, but fail to provide a plausible explanation for their existence.23 Still others, after picking out one parallel and dismissing it as too “subtle,” proceed as if they have explained away the presence of all of the parallels.24
In my opinion, none of these approaches is convincing. Instead, the most plausible explanation is also the simplest: In both the annunciation and the visitation, Luke is depicting Mary as the new Ark.25 In the words of the Protestant scholar Max Thurian:
One might further relate the account of Mary’s visitation to Elizabeth with the account of the bearing of the Ark of the covenant by David…She has seen Mary the one who bears the Holy Presence, and she cannot withhold the great cry of ecstasy which characterized the appearance of the Ark as the place of the Lord’s Presence.26
In support of this conclusion, it’s important to remember (as we just saw) that many scholars recognize the parallel between the annunciation to Mary and the descent of the “glory cloud” upon the Tabernacle. If this is correct, then the presence of allusions to the Ark in the account of the visitation is perfectly consistent with Luke’s earlier depiction of Mary. Moreover, the intention to reveal Mary as the new Ark would explain why Luke rather curiously says Mary stayed with Elizabeth for “three months” (Luke 1:56). Why doesn’t Luke just say Mary stayed “until the birth of John”? The best explanation for this chronological detail is that Luke is subtly but deliberately alluding to the story of the Ark staying in the house of Obed-Edom for “three months” (2 Samuel 6:11).27
In short, just as Luke portrays Jesus as the new Moses who will bring about the new exodus, so too Mary is being revealed as the new Ark—the new dwelling place of God’s presence on earth.
The Book of Revelation: The Ark and the Woman in Heaven
Finally, the Gospel of Luke is not the only New Testament book that forges a link between Mary and the Ark of the Covenant. Something similar takes place in the book of Revelation.
I am referring once again to John’s famous vision of the “woman clothed with the sun” (Revelation 12:1–2). As we saw in Chapter 2, there are solid reasons for concluding that the woman in Revelation 12 is the mother of the Messiah. What I did not point out in that chapter is that there is also a close connection between the woman and the lost Ark. You can see this connection by backing up a few verses and putting the vision of the woman in context:
Then God’s temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant appeared within his temple; and there were flashes of lightning, voices, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. And a great portent appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; she was with child and she cried out in her pangs of birth, in anguish for delivery. (Revelation 11:19–12:2)28
Notice three things about this mysterious passage.
First, although most English translations insert a “chapter” break between the appearance of the Ark and the appearance of the woman, no such division exists in the original Greek text. The contemporary system of chapters and verses was not added to the Bible until the thirteenth century by the Catholic archbishop of Canterbury Stephen Langton.29 Hence, as experts on Revelation agree, the verse in which the Ark appears is not the end of the previous chapter but the beginning of a new section: It “introduces” the vision in which the woman appears.30
Second, both the Ark and the woman appear to be in the heavenly Temple. Notice the imagery of “noises” or “voices” (Greek phōnai) coming from the heavenly “temple” and a woman “in anguish for delivery” (Revelation 11:19, 12:2). These images are taken directly from the book of Isaiah: “A voice from the temple! The voice of the LORD, rendering recompense to his enemies! Before she was in labor she gave birth; before her pain came upon her she was delivered of a son” (Isaiah 66:6–7). We’ll come back to this remarkable prophecy later in the book. For now, the main point is that it strongly suggests that Revelation is situating both the Ark and the woman in the heavenly Temple. One reason this matters is that, as one New Testament scholar writes: “The presence of the ark of the covenant in the heavenly temple implies that it is the ‘true’ ark.”31 No first-century Jew who was waiting for the return of the lost Ark could read this vision in Revelation without being stunned that the true Ark was no longer on earth but in heaven.
Third and finally, the heavenly Ark is being associated with the heavenly woman. As the Protestant New Testament scholar Craig Koester points out in his commentary on Revelation, the repetition of the word “appeared” (Greek ōphthē) clearly “links the manifestation of the Ark” to the vision of the woman in the very next verse. Just as the Ark “appears” in heaven, so too the woman “appears” in heaven (Revelation 11:19, 12:1).32
What are the implications of all these observations? Although Revelation does not explicitly refer to Mary as the true Ark, the fact that it describes the Ark and the woman so close to one another is remarkable. At the very least, it implies that the woman (the mother of the Messiah) is in the same place the true Ark is—the heavenly Holy of Holies. Even more, it implies that for John, the woman and the Ark are dual symbols for the same person. This makes sense given John’s love for dual symbols: Just as the “dragon” and the “serpent” are dual symbols for “the Devil” (Revelation 12:3, 9), and the “male child” and “the Lamb” are dual symbols for Christ (Revelation 12:5, 11), so the “Ark” and the “woman” are dual symbols for Mary, the mother of the Messiah (Revelation 11:19, 12:1). That, at least, is how the ninth-century Christian author Paschasius Radbertus interpreted the book of Revelation when he wrote: “The temple of God was open and the Ark of the Covenant was seen. This certainly was not the Ark made by Moses, but is the Blessed Virgin…”33
ASSUMED INTO HEAVEN
Now that we have studied ancient Jewish beliefs about the Ark of the Covenant as well as the New Testament parallels between Mary and the Ark, we can bring this chapter to a close by drawing out three important theological implications from what we’ve learned.
Mary’s Body: The Dwelling Place of God on Earth
First and foremost, if Mary is the new Ark, then her body is nothing less than the dwelling place of God on earth.
Think about it. The old Ark was made of “pure gold” and kept in the “Holy of Holies” because it was “the place” where God would descend from heaven to “meet” his people. It was the sacred container for the Ten Commandments, the manna from heaven, and the staff of Aaron (Hebrews 9:4). So now the new and greater Ark must likewise be free from any impurity and completely holy. Mary is the sacred vessel for the “Word” made flesh, the “Bread of Life,” and the true “high priest”:
The Ark of the Covenant
Mary, the New Ark
1. Ten Commandments
1. “Word” made “Flesh”
2. Golden Urn of Manna
2. “Bread of Life” from Heaven
3. Staff of Aaron that Budded (Hebrews 9:4)
3. Heavenly “High Priest” (John 1:14, 6:53–58)
Now, if Mary is the new Ark, and the Ark is the dwelling place of God on earth, then, by implication, Jesus is God on earth. In other words, he is divine. The mystery of Mary’s identity as the new Ark illuminates the even deeper mystery of Jesus’ divinity.
And I’m not the first one to see this. The link between Mary and the Ark and the divinity of Christ was noticed by Christians writing long ago. Consider the words of ancient Christians writing in Rome, Egypt, and Syria:
The Lord was made without sin, made in His human nature of incorruptible wood, that is to say, of the Virgin and the Holy Spirit, overlaid within and without, as it were, by purest gold of the word of God…Tell me, O Blessed Mary, what it was that was conceived by you in the womb; what it was that was borne by you in a Virgin’s womb. It was the Word of God, firstborn from Heaven. (Hippolytus of Rome, Discourse on Psalm 23 [2nd–3rd century A.D.])34
O noble Virgin, truly you are greater than any other greatness. For who is your equal in greatness, O dwelling place of God the Word?…O [Ark of the New] Covenant, clothed with purity instead of gold! You are the Ark in which is found the golden vessel containing the true manna, that is, the flesh in which divinity resides…You carry within you the feet, the head, and the entire body of the perfect God…you are God’s place of repose. (Athanasius of Alexandria, Homily from the Papyrus of Turin [4th century A.D.])35
The Mother, Virgin and blessed, was even more beautiful than the Ark full of mysteries of the house of God…While the Ark was being carried, David had danced for joy…He typified in figure the way of Mary with John [the Baptist], for also that maiden was the Ark of the Godhead. (Jacob of Serug, Homily III on the Mother of God, 671 [5th–6th century A.D.])36
Notice how these ancient Christians get their beliefs from the Old Testament, and not just the New Testament. Notice also that they base their beliefs about Mary on what they believe about Christ. Nor has this ancient belief disappeared. It continues to be taught in the recent Catechism of the Catholic Church, which states: “Mary, in whom the Lord himself has just made his dwelling, is…the ark of the covenant” (CCC 2676).
The Assumption of Mary into Heaven
As we will see in Chapter 4, the New Testament depicts Jesus as a new Davidic king—a kind of “new David” (cf. Matthew 1:1). Now, if Mary is the new Ark of the Covenant, then it makes sense that Jesus, the new David, would bring her up into heaven to be with him forever in the heavenly Temple. In other words, the New Testament revelation of Mary as the new Ark is essential for understanding the belief in her bodily assumption into heaven.37
In order to see this clearly, it’s important to recall that once David was made king, one of his first priorities was to “bring up” the Ark to Jerusalem and place it “inside” the Tabernacle (2 Samuel 6:17). As we saw earlier, this momentous event was memorialized in Psalm 132: “Arise, O LORD, and go to your resting place, you and the ark of your might” (Psalm 132:8). Now, if Jesus is the new David, who has ascended into the heavenly Jerusalem, then it makes sense that he would likewise bring the true Ark of the Covenant—his mother—into the heavenly Temple.
That, at least, is what ancient Christians believed. To be sure, the earliest references to Mary being “taken up” into heaven that we possess base their claim on the fact that the “woman” in Revelation 12 is “in heaven.”38 However, later Christian writers linked it with her identity as the Ark. Consider the beautiful words of Modestus of Jerusalem and John Damascene regarding Mary’s “Dormition” or “Falling Asleep” (Greek koimēsis):
When she [Mary] had completed her life’s voyage happily…the one who gave the Law on Sinai, and who administered it from Sion, our God, summoned his ark of sanctification to be brought home from Zion to himself, just as David, her ancestor, had said of her in a psalm, “Go up, O Lord, to the place of your rest, you and your ark of sanctification” (Ps 132:8). She is not carried like Moses’ ark of old, drawn by oxen, but she is escorted and surrounded by an army, heaven’s holy angels (Modestus of Jerusalem, Encomium on the Dormition of Mary, 4 [7th century A.D.])39
Today the holy, incomparable virgin enters the heavenly sanctuary that lies above the universe…Today the holy, living ark of the living God, the one who carried her own maker within herself, comes to her rest in the temple of the Lord not made by hands. David—her ancestor and God’s—leaps for joy; the angels join in the dance. (John Damascene, On the Dormition of Mary, II.2 [8th century A.D.])40
In light of such words, it comes as no surprise that when Pope Pius XII eventually defined the dogma of Mary’s bodily assumption into heaven, in 1950, he specifically cited Modestus of Jerusalem and John Damascene as examples of ancient Christian writers who “looked upon the Ark of the Covenant, built of incorruptible wood and placed in the Lord’s temple, as a type of the most pure body of the Virgin Mary, preserved and exempt from all the corruption of the tomb and raised up to such glory in heaven” (Pope Pius XII, Munificentissimus Deus, 26).41 For if the wood of the old Ark was both “holy” and “incorruptible,” then how much more should the body of Mary, the new Ark, be not only holy but free from the corruption of the grave?
This ancient connection between the Ark, the woman, and the bodily assumption of Mary makes sense when we remember that the new Ark is not just Mary’s soul but her body. In the recent words of Pope Benedict XVI:
The passage from the Book of Revelation also indicates another important aspect of Mary’s reality. As the living Ark of the Covenant, she has an extraordinary destiny of glory because she is so closely united to the Son whom she welcomed in faith and generated in the flesh, as to share fully in his glory in Heaven. This is what the words we have heard suggest: “A great portent appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun…” (Rev 12:1)…Mary, Mother of God, full of grace, fully docile to the action of the Holy Spirit, already lives in God’s Heaven with her whole being, body and soul.” (Benedict XVI, “Homily Mass for the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary,” August 15, 2011)42
In other words, it was in Mary’s body that “the Word” became “flesh” and “dwelt among us” (John 1:14). Therefore it is fitting that her body, the true Ark, be taken up into the heavenly Holy of Holies.
Mary’s Assumption: A Sign of Our Resurrection
I began this chapter with the modern-day quest for the lost Ark. We can bring it to a close by returning to the question Where is the “lost” Ark? Was it taken to Babylon? Is it somewhere in Ethiopia? Is it hidden in Mount Nebo?
At the end of the day, it really doesn’t matter. In fact, the book of Jeremiah actually contains a prophecy that in the future age, “the ark of the covenant…shall not come to mind, or be remembered, or missed; it shall not be made again” (Jeremiah 3:16). After all, the New Testament tells us exactly where the true Ark is: “in heaven” (Revelation 11:19). In this way, it shows us that the old Ark of the Covenant has been transcended by the true dwelling place of God: Mary, the mother of “the Word” made “flesh” (John 1:14). She is the one who, through God’s grace, has been made completely holy. She is the one whose body has been preserved from corruption and taken up into the heavenly Holy of Holies to be with the risen Jesus for all eternity.
As the new Moses, Jesus ascends “into heaven” in his body to show us that the earthly promised land is not the ultimate destination of his “exodus” (Luke 9:31). The true exodus begins in this world and ends in the heavenly world to come. In a similar way, Mary’s identity as the new Ark, who is made holy by God’s grace, preserved from bodily corruption, and assumed into heaven, sheds light on the destiny of our bodies and souls. Jesus dies and rises again so that the body of every person can be transformed by grace into a “temple of the holy spirit” (1 Corinthians 6:19). Although Mary is just a human being, Jesus gives her a unique share in his glory. Mary’s assumption shows us that bodily resurrection and ascension into heaven aren’t just for Jesus. They are for us too.43
But the mysteries of the mother of the Messiah do not end here. We have still not answered what is perhaps the most pressing question for many: Why is so much honor given to Mary? Why the veneration? In order to explain this, we need to turn to the third key prefiguration of Mary in Jewish Scripture: the royal queen mother.
